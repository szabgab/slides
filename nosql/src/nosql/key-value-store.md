# Key-value store


Like a persistent hash-map. The key is usually a string. The value can be 


* [MemcacheDB](http://memcachedb.org/) (not developed any more) 
* [Riak](http://basho.com/riak/) (Basho)
* [Redis](http://redis.io/)



The line between document stores and key-value stores is blurry, Martin Fowler calls them "Aggregate-oriented" databases.
A data-store is a lot more flexible in what can we search on.
