# Cassandra



* CQL = Cassandra Query Language (like SQL, but no joins, and need to have index (clustering) for each field in the WHERE clause)
* RF = Replication Factor (how many times each piece of data is replicated)
* CL = Consistency Level (ONE, QUORUM, ALL) (How many reads or writes need to happen before we consider the read or write "done")
