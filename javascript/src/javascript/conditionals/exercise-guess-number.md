# Exercise: Guess number

When the page is loaded the computer "thinks" about a random whole number
between 1 and 200, and displays an input box and a button "guess".
The user types in a number and the computer will check if the given
number is "smaller" or "larger" than the number it "though" about, or
if they happen to be equal.

Once that's done, change the solution so it will count how many times has the user
guessed before the coreect number was found.
