# var - variables in JavaScript

* use strict
* var

{% embed include file="src/examples/js/var.js" %}

* "use strict"; (later explained)
* Declare variables using 'var'
* Variable names start with letters, underscore (_), or the dollar sign.
* Variable names can contain letters, underscore (_), the dollar sign, and digits.
* camelCase is the recommended style in JavaScript, though I think long_names separated with underscores are nicer.
