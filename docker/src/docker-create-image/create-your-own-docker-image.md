# Create your own Docker image


There are two ways to create a Docker image on your computer:


* Run a container, install stuff, stop it, commit it.
* Create Dockerfile, run docker build.


We will do both, but we start with the first one.
It is less common, but it is more fun and it is easier to understand.

Besides while you are researching a topic you will follow the path of the first
technique, only when you found the way to accomplish some task will you formalize it in a Dockerfile.
