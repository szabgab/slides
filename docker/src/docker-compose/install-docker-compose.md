# Install Docker compose



Docker compose allows us to configure several docker images to be launched together so they can nicely work together.
For example one image holds the database server, another one holds the message-passing system, and the third holds the code of the web application.

Docker compose can run them all at once and can also define the network connectivity between them.

There are several ways to install Docker composer. One of them, if you are familiar with Python, is using `pip`.


```
pip install docker-compose
```
