# Docker on Windows

* cmd


The majority of our work with Docker will be on the command line. There probably is some GUI as well, but I have never searched for one
and I have never tried one. In any case I think it is very important that you too, even if you are using MS Windows on your computer
make yourself familiar with the command line instructions of Docker. After all that's how you'll be able to talk to other people
or search for help.

If you are running Docker on top of MS Windows you'll need to open the Command Prompt Window to access the command line of Windows.
So go to Start/Run or click on the "Windows" button on your keyboard and type in "cmd". When you run this application you'll get a black
window where you can type in command.

That's what we are going to use.


* Run the `cmd`
