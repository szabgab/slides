## Companies using Docker in Israel
{id: docker-in-israel}

{aside}
I know that most of the readers of these slides are from around the world, but I run most of my courses in Israel,
so I have special interest in knowing which companies are using docker and what job titles do the people who use it have.
At one point I might create similar pages for some other countries as well.
