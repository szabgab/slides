# The real game


* There is a spaceship somewhere in the 1-dimensional space. We don't know what is its distance from us.
* We shoot at some distance. We are told if we hit the space-ship or if our shot was too short or too long.
* Then we can adjust.

* In the advanced level of the game, the enemy space-ship also moves.
