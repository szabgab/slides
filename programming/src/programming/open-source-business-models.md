# Open Source business models

* Undermine competitors (Google, now even Microsoft does it)

* Create a huge user-base, a small fraction of it will pay money for hosting (MongoDB, Redis) or extra features (GitLab).
* Get paied for support (e.g. RedHat)
* Dual licenses (one version as GPL, other as some corporate-friendly license)

* Get developer mind-share (VS Code by Microsoft, React by Facebook, ...)
