# Y2K problem

* Y2K

Y2K problem (time represented as the last two digit of the year.

Instead of 1985 we wrote 85  saved space, looked clear. You also knew that the year 86 was after the year 85 becasue 86 > 85.
It worked until 1999, but when 2000 came it was (supposed to be) represented as 00.

Suddenly tomorrow was before yesterday.
