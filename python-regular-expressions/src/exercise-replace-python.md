# Exercise: Replace Python

Write a script called **replace_python.py** that given a file will replace all occurrences of "Python" or "python" by Java,
but will avoid replacing the word in Monty Python. It prints the resulting rows to the screen.

For example given the input:

{% embed include file="src/examples/regex/text_with_python.txt" %}

Will print:

{% embed include file="src/examples/regex/text_with_java.txt" %}
