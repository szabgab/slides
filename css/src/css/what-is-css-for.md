# What is CSS for?


* Provide a relatively easy way to change how a group of HTML pages look like.




Each CSS rule is a combination of a **selector** that selects to which specific element the rule applies to.
(for example the a element within a p element that is in the "news" class.)

An attribute  (for example color).

And a values for that attribute. (For example red.)

```css
p.news a {
  color: red;
}
```
