# Process an entire file line by line (while, cat)

* while

* while - executes as long as there is something in $line, as long as there are lines in the file
* Loop over file (name hard-coded) and print every line (UNIX cat)

{% embed include file="src/examples/files-perl/cat.pl" %}

```
Instead of printing the line you could do anything with it.
