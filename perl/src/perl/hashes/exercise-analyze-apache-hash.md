# Exercise: Analyze Apache log file

In the files section earlier we had a an example counting
how many hits came from localhost and from other places.

Please improve that analyzer to provide a report:
which client IP address were used and how many hits were from
each IP address.

The log file can be found here:
examples/files-perl/apache_access.log
