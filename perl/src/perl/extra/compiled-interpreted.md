# Is Perl Interpreted or Compiled Language

* Compiled languages: C, C++
* Compiled and interpreted languages: Java, Perl
* Interpreted languages: BASIC (or Shell)

Perl is in the middle as it is compiled to a byte tree (similarly to Java)
that is never saved as a file. It also requires the interpreter to be available
with the Perl program.

Advantages of a compiled language:

* Can be faster especially in short applications
* Does not need a compiler/interpreter/Virtual Machine on the users machine (it can be distributed on its own)

Disadvantages of a compiled language:

* It has to be compiled separately to every platform
* Difficult to make it platform independent
