# Redirection by the user

In order to read a real file we have to wait for a later chapter or you can ask the user of the script to use redirection on the command line.

The user of out program might do the following to redirect the input and/or the output of our program.

```
myperl.pl &lt; in.txt
myperl.pl &gt; out.txt
myperl.pl &lt; in.txt  &gt; out.txt
```
