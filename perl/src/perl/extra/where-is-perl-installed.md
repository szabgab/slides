# Where is perl installed on your system ?

It can be installed in any place but usually you'll find it in one of the
following places:

on UNIX:

```
/usr/bin/perl
/usr/local/bin/perl
```

on Windows:

```
c:\perl\bin\perl.exe
```

In addition you'll find a bunch of Perl standard modules installed somewhere
on the system.
