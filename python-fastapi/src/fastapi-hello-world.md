# FastAPI -  Hello World

* FastAPI
* get
* virtualenv

* The requirements include both `FastAPI` and `pytest` so we can write and run tests for our web application.

{% embed include file="src/examples/fastapi/hello-world/requirements.txt" %}


* It is recommended to set up a virtual environment or use some other way to separate environments.

```
virtualenv -p python3 venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

* We need a single file in which we `import` the `FastAPI` class.
* We then create an instance of it. We can call it any name, but most of the examples are using `app` so we'll use that as well.
* For each URL path we need to create a mapping to indicate which function needs to be executed when someone access that path.
* The functions are defined as `async` so FastAPI can handle several requests at the same time. The name of the function does not matter.
* The decorator `@app.get("/")` is doing the mapping.
* The function needs to return some Python data structure that will be converted to JSON when it is sent back to the client.


{% embed include file="src/examples/fastapi/hello-world/main.py" %}

* In order to see this working launch the development web server that comes with the installation of FastAPI.

```
fastapi dev main.py
```
