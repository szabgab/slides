# Exercise: Hello World


* The primary goal of this exercise is to make sure you have your environment ready to write more code.
* Create a file called `hello.js` and make it print "Hello World".
* Run the code from the command line.
* Run the code from your IDE, if you use one.
* Add some comments to your code and check if you can still run it.
