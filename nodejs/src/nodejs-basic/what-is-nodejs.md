* Node is a runtime environment for executing JavaScript code.
* Non-blocking (asynchronous) architecture.
* It has an event loop with event queue.
* It is good for network-intensive apps, but not good for CPU intensive applications.
* Running on top of the V8 Virtual Machine written by Google, which is also the JavaScript engine in Chrome.
