# Flask URL routing


The mapping of the path part of a URL, so the one that comes after the domain name and
after the port number (if it is included) is the path. Mapping that to a function call
is called routing.

In the following pages we are going to see several examples on how to map routes to functions.

It is also called "url route registration".
