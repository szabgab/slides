# Exercise: Convert your script to module

* Take one of your real scripts (from work or from a previous assignment). Create a backup copy.
* Change the script so it can be import-ed as a module and then it won't automatically execute anything, but that it still works when executed as a script.
* Add a new function to it called `self_test` and in that function add a few test-cases to your code using 'assert'.
* Write another script that will load your real file as a module and will run the `self_test`.
* Let me know what are the dificulties!
