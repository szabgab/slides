# Exercise: Add doctests to your own code

* Pick a module from your own code and create a backup copy. (from work)
* Add a function called 'self_test' that uses 'assert' to test some of the real functions of the module.
* Add code that will run the 'self_test' when the file is executed as a script.
* Add documentation to one of the functions and convert the 'assert'-based tests to doctests.
* Convert the mechanism that executed the 'self_test' to run the doctests as well.
* Let me know what are the dificulties!
