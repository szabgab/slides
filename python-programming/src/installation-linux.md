# Installation on Linux


* On Linux you usually have Python 2 installed in **/usr/bin/python**
* Python 3 in **/usr/bin/python3**.
* If they are not installed, you can install them with the appropriate **yum** or **apt-get** command of your distribution.
* An alternative is to install [Anaconda with Python 3.x](https://www.anaconda.com/download/)


```
$ which python3

$ sudo apt-get install python3
$ sudo yum install python3
```
