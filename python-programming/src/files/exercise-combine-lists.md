# Exercise: Combine lists

{% embed include file="src/examples/files/a.txt" %}
{% embed include file="src/examples/files/b.txt" %}

Write a script called **combine_lists.py** that takes the two files and combines them adding the values for each vegetable. The expected result is:

{% embed include file="src/examples/files/c.txt" %}
