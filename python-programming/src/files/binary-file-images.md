# Binary files: Images


This is just a quick example how to use the Pillow module to handle images. There is a whole chapter on dealing with images.

* [Pillow](https://pillow.readthedocs.io/en/stable/)

```
pip install pillow
```

{% embed include file="src/examples/files/resize_image_demo.py" %}

```
python examples/files/get_image_size.py examples/pil/first.png
```


**Output:**

{% embed include file="src/examples/files/get_image_size.out" %}
