# What is Python?

* A snake.
* A British comedy group called [Monty Python](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monty_Python).
* A programming language. The definition of the language: words, punctuation (operators) and grammar (syntax).
* The compiler/interpreter of the Python programming language. (aka. CPython).


When people say they Python in relation to programming they either mean the Python programming language or they
mean the tool that can translate some text (code) written in the Python programming language to the language a computer
can actually understand. On MS Windows this is the **python.exe** you need to install. On Linux/Mac it is usually called **python**
or **python3**. The generic name of the tool that translates a programming language for the computer is either
called a compiler or an interpreter. We'll talk about this later on.
