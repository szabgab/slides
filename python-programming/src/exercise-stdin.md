# Exercise: Standard Input

* In the previous exercises we expected the user-input to come in on the "Standard Input" aka. STDIN.
* If you would like to practice this more, come up with other ideas, try to solve them and tell me about the task. (in person or via e-mail.)
* (e.g. you could start building an interactive role-playing game.)

* Name the file **basic2_stdin.py**
