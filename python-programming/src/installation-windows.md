# Installation on MS Windows

* [Download](http://www.python.org/download/).

* Make sure the "Add Python 3.10 to PATH" check-box is checked.

Alternatively, if Python was installed without that checkbox, one can re-run the installation,
select "Modify installation" and then check the box on "Add Python to environment variables".
