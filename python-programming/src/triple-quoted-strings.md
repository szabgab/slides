# Triple quoted strings (multiline)


* """
* '''


If you would like to create a string that spreads on multiple lines,
there is a possibility to put the text between 3 quotes on both sides. Either 2*3 single-quotes
or 2*3 double-quotes.


{% embed include file="src/examples/strings/triple_quotes.py" %}
{% embed include file="src/examples/strings/triple_quotes.out" %}

Can spread multiple lines.
