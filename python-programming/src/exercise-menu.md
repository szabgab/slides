# Exercise: color selector menu


* In a script called **color_selector_menu.py** have a list of colors. Write a script that will display a menu (a list of numbers and the corresponding color) and prompts the user for a number. The user needs to type in one of the numbers. That's the selected color.


1. blue
1. green
1. yellow
1. white


* For extra credit make sure the system is user-proof and it won't blow up on various incorrect input values. (e.g Floating point number. Number that is out of range, non-number)
* For more credit allow the user to supply the number of the color on the command line. **python color_selector_menu.py 3**. If that is available, don't prompt.
* For further credit allow the user to provide the name of the color on the command line: **python color_selector_menu.py yellow** Can you handle color names that are not in the expected case (e.g. YelloW)?
* Any more ideas for improvement?
