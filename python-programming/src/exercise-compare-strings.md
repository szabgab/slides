# Exercise: compare strings

* Create a file called **bool_compare_strings.py**
* You can use the `len()` function to get the length of the string.
* Ask the user to enter two strings
* Then ask the user to select if she wants to compare them based on Unicode or based on their length
* Then tell us which one is bigger.

```
Input a string: (user types string and ENTER)
Input another string: (user types string and ENTER)
How to compare:
