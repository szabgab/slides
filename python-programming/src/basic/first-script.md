# First script - hello world

{% embed include file="src/examples/basics/hello.py" %}

* Create a file called **hello.py** with the above content.
* Open your terminal or the Anaconda Prompt on MS Windows in the directory (folder)
* Change to the directory  where you saved the file.
* Run it by typing **python hello.py** or **python3 hello.py**
* The extension is .py - mostly for the editor (but also for modules).
* Parentheses after print() are required in Python 3, but use them even if you are stuck on Python 2.
