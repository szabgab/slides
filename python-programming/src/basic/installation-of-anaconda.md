# Installation of Anaconda


Anaconda is a package that includes Python and a bunch of other tools.
I used to recommend it, but these days I prefer a plain installation of Python from python.org.

* [Anaconda with Python 3.x](https://www.anaconda.com/download/)
* Anaconda shell
* Anaconda Jupyter notebook
