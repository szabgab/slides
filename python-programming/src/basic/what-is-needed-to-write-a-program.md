# What is needed to write a program?


* An **editor** where we can write in a language.
* A **compiler or interpreter** that can translate our text to the language of the computer.


In order to write and run a program you basically need two things. A text editor in which you can write the program
and a compiler or interpreter that can translate this program to the computer.
