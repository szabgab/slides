{% embed include file="src/examples/format/format.py" %}
{% embed include file="src/examples/format/format.out" %}

* When using % to print more than one value, put the values in parentheses forming a tuple.
* In version 2.6 and below you need to write {0} {1} etc, as a placeholder of the format method.
* f-strings were added in Python 3.6 (released on 2016-12-23)
