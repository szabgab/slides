# Change a List

{% embed include file="src/examples/lists/change.py" %}

* Unlike strings, lists are mutable. You can change the content of a list by assigning values to its elements.
* You can use the slice notation to change several elements at once.
* You can even have different number of elements in the slice and in the replacement. This will also change the length of the array.
