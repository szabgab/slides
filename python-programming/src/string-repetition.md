# String repetition and concatenation

* *
* +


You might be used to the fact that you can only multiply numbers, but in python you can also "multiply" a string by a number.
It is called repetition. In this example we have a string "Jar " that we repeat twice.

We can also add two strings to concatenate them together.

I don't think the repetition operator is used very often, but in one case it could come in very handy.
When you are writing some text report and you'd like to add a long line of dashes that would be exactly the same length
as your title.
