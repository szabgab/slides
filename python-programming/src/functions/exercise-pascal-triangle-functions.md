# Exercise: Pascal's triangle functions

* Create a file called **pascal_triangle_functions.py** that will do exactly as the previous one, but this time make sure you have these functions:

* A function that given a list of numbers (a row from the triangle, e.g. 1, 3, 3, 1) will return the next row (1, 4, 6, 4, 1). **get_next_row**
* A function that given a depth N will return a list of the first N rows. **get_triangle**
* A function that will print the triangle. **print_triangle**.
