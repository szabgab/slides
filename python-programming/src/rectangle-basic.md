# Rectangle (numerical operations)


* =
* *


In this example we create two variables `width` and `height` containing the numbers 23 and 17 respectively.

Unlike in math, in programming in general where you see a single equal sign `=` it means **assignment**. It means we want the value on the right-hand-side to be in the variable on the left-hand-side.

Others might say make the word/name on the left-hand-side of the `=` sign refer to the value that is on the right-hand-side.

In any case this is not a mathematical statement of truth not an equation, but a statement of an action.

On the next line we multiply the values in two already existing variable and assign the result to a third variable called `area`.

At the end we use the `print` function that we have already seen, to print out the results on the screen.

A simple mathematical operation.
