# Solution for Number Guessing (debug)


One important thing is to remember that you can create a toggle by just calling `not` on a boolean variable every time you'd like to flip the switch.

The other one is that flipping the switch (pressing d) and printing the current value because debug mode is on, are two separate operations that are not directly related
and so they can be implemented separately.
