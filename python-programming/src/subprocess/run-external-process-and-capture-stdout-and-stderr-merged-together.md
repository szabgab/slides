# Run external process and capture STDOUT and STDERR merged together


{% embed include file="src/examples/process/run_command_combine_stderr_and_stdout.py" %}

**Output:**

{% embed include file="src/examples/process/run_command_combine_stderr_and_stdout.out" %}

In this case stderr will always be `None`.
