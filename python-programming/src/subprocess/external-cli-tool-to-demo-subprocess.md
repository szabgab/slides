# External CLI tool to demo subprocess


* subprocess
* call
* execute


The process.py is a simple script we are going to use to demonstrate how an external program can be executed from within Python.
It is a Python program, but you could do the exact same thing with any command-line application written in any language.
We use this Python script as an example because we know you already have Python on your computer.


The external command:

{% embed include file="src/examples/process/process.py" %}

Try it on the command line: `python process.py 3 7`
