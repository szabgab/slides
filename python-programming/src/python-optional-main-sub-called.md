# The main function - called


* main
* def


In this example I added 3 lines to the previous file. The line `main()` calls the main function. We sometimes also say "runs the function" or "invokes the function".
In this context they mean the same.

The two print-statements are not necessary to call the function, I only added them so it will be easy to see the order of the operations that you can observe
by looking at the output.


{% embed include file="src/examples/basics/hello_world.py" %}

```
before
Hello
World
after
```


* Use a main function to avoid globals and better structure your code.
* Python uses **indentation** for blocks instead of curly braces, and it uses the colon **:** to start a block.
