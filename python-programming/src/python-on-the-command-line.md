# Python on the command line


* -V|options
* -c|options

More or less the only thing I do on the command line with python is to check the version number:


```
python -V
python --version
```


You can run some Python code without creating a file, but I don't remember ever needing this. If you insist


```
python -c "print 42"
```

```
python3 -c "print(42)"
```

Type the following to get the details:


```
man python
```
