{% embed include file="src/examples/basics/print.py" %}

```
hello
world
Foo Bar
```
{% embed include file="src/examples/basics/print_no_newline.py" %}

```
hello world
Foo Bar
```

No newline, but a space is added at the end of the output and between values.

{% embed include file="src/examples/basics/write.py" %}

```
helloworld

write takes exactly one parameter
