# Compilation vs. Interpretation

**Compiled**

* Languages: C, C++
* Development cycle: Edit, Compile (link), Run.
* Strong syntax checking during compilation and linking.
* Result: Stand-alone executable code.
* Need to compile to each platform separately. (Windows, Linux, Mac, 32bit vs 64bit).

**Interpreted**

* Shell, BASIC
* Development cycle: Edit, Run.
* Syntax check only during run-time.
* Result: we distribute the source code.
* Needs the right version of the interpreted on every target machine.

**Both?**

* Java (running on JVM - Java Virtual Machine)
* C# (running on CLR - Common Language Runtime)
