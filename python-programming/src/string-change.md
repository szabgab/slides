# Change a string


* immutable


In Python strings are "immutable", meaning you cannot change them. You can replace a whole string in a variable,
but you cannot change it.

In the following example we wanted to replace the 3rd character (index 2), and put "Y" in place. This raised an exception


{% embed include file="src/examples/strings/string_change.py" %}

{% embed include file="src/examples/strings/string_change.out" %}


Replace part of a string



* Strings in Python are **immutable** - they never change.
