* [SciPy](https://www.scipy.org/) ecosystem of open-source software for mathematics, science, and engineering.
* [BioPython](https://biopython.org/) tools for biological computation.
* [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/) to handle N-dimensional arrays.
* [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) Python Data Analysis Library. (Data Frames)
* [Matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/) a 2D plotting library.
* [Seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/) data visualization library based on matplotlib.
* [Bokeh](https://bokeh.pydata.org/) interactive visualization library.
* [SciKit-Learn](http://scikit-learn.org/) Machine Learning in Python. (name from: SciPy Toolkit)
* [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/) Machine learning framework. (primarily for deep-learning) (developed by Google engineer)
* [Keras](https://keras.io/) Machine learning framework (primarily for deep-learning, neural-network). (On top of Tensorflow and now part of it.)
* [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/) Machine learnng framework. (primarily for deep-learning) (from Facebook)
