# Pytest: Mocking - why?


* Testing environment that does not depend on external systems.
* Faster tests (mock remote calls, mock whole databases, etc.)
* Fake some code/application/API that does not exist yet.
* Test error conditions in a system not under our control.

* TDD, unit tests
* Spaghetti code
* Simulate hard to replicate cases
* 3rd party APIs  or applications
