# Pytest parametrized fixture

Sometimes we would like to pass some parameters to the fixture. We can do this with one or more parameters.

{% embed include file="src/examples/pytest/test_parametrized_fixture.py" %}

**Output:**

{% embed include file="src/examples/pytest/test_parametrized_fixture.out" %}
