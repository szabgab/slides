# Pytest a nice Fibonacci example

This is a nice implementation of the Fibonacci function. If we look at the way we can use it we see that it works well for 10.

{% embed include file="src/examples/pytest/fib1/fibonacci.py" %}
{% embed include file="src/examples/pytest/fib1/use_fib.py" %}

**Output:**

{% embed include file="src/examples/pytest/fib1/use_fib.out" %}
