# Object Oriented Programming - OOP in Perl

When would you need to learn how to write Object Oriented code in Perl?

## Case 1.

You can accomplish a **lot** by using Perl in a procedural way, writing statements, functions, and even moving out some functions to modules. At one point you'll encounter a module that is itself written in the Object Oriented paradigm.
In order to use that module you'll need to learn a slightly different syntax. It is still not Object Oriented programming, but it is already using some classes and instances.

As you create more complex projects you might start to feel that you need a better organization of your data and functions. One such solution would be to convert some of your code to Object Oriented Perl.

## Case 2.

You get tasked to maintain a project that was already written in Object Oriented Perl and now you need to understand the internal working of the classes.


## Vocabulary

OOP or Object Oriented Programming is not the same in every programming language. Each implementation has its own features. However there is a mostly common vocabulary. I wrote "mostly" as even
the vocabulary used for various features of OOP might differ among programming languages. Let's see what are the words usually used:

* class
* instance (sometimes called object)
* constructor
* initializer
* destructor
* members
* attributes
* methods (class and instance methods)
* accessors (getters and setters)
* inheritance
* polymorphism
* encapsulation

* singleton
