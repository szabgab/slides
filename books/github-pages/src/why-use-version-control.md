## Why use version control?

* Everyone uses some version control. (e.g. by copying the document with a date suffix).
* There are many version control systems (VCSs).
* `git` is the de-facto standard these days. It is open source and free. It is integrated in many tools.
* [GitHub](https://github.com/) is the most popular cloud-based hosting service for `git` repositories with many extra features.

* In this session we will use `git` only via the web-site of GitHub.
