# GitHub Account

* If you don't have an account yet on [GitHub](https://github.com/) then create one now.
* It should be personal. It will remain with you for your life. (or the life of GitHub)
* It should not be related to your current educational institute or workplace or this presentation or course.

* My account is [szabgab on GitHub](https://github.com/szabgab/). It is my nickname almost everywhere on the Internet. It is even the address of [my web site](https://szabgab.com/).
