# Setting up GitHub page

* Create a GitHub repository called USERNAME.github.io (using your own USERNAME).
* For user [szabgab](https://github.com/szabgab/) it is [szabgab.github.io](https://github.com/szabgab/szabgab.github.io).
* Make the new repository public so everyone will be able to see the source.
* Check the "Add a README file" checkbox.

* Check the `Actions` tab to see the process generating the web site.

* Visit https://USERNAME.github.io (it may take a few minutes to update)
* For user szabgab it is [szabgab.github.io](https://szabgab.github.io/).
* For GitHub Organizations it is exactly the same process.
