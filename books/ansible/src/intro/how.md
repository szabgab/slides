# How

Configuration management software - we have many options today:

* CFEngine  - runs on C
* Puppet    - Ruby , series of steps
* Chef      - DSL (Ruby-based) , declarative
* Ansible   - Python , series of steps (like a script), YAML files
* SaltStack - YAML files

These are just a short list, you can read comparison of all the different apps via [Puppet vs. Chef vs. Ansible vs. Salt](https://www.google.co.il/search?q=Puppet+vs.+Chef+vs.+Ansible+vs.+Salt&oq=Puppet+vs.+Chef+vs.+Ansible+vs.+Salt&aqs=chrome..69i57j0j69i60l2j0l2.914j0j1&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8).

Wikipedia has a very nice [Comparison of open-source configuration management software page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_open-source_configuration_management_software).
