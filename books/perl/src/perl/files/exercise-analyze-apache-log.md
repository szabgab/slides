# Exercise: Analyze Apache - number of successful hits


In the Apache log file (examples/files-perl/apache_access.log)
after the "GET something HTTP/1.1" part there is the
result code of the requests. 200 is OK the rest might be some failure.




Please create a report showing how many of the hits were successful (200)
and how many were something else.




Could you put all the lines in either of the categories?
