# Loop controls: next, last

* next
* last

* **next** - evaluate the loop condition and if it is true go to the next iteration. (**continue** in other languages)
* **last** - exit the loop. (**break** in other languages)
* **redo** - start the iteration again without evaluating the loop condition.
