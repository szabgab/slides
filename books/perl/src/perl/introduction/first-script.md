{% embed include file="src/examples/firstperl/hello_world.pl" %}


run it by typing
`perl hello_world.pl`

On unix you can also make it executable:
`chmod u+x hello_world.pl`
and then run like:
`./hello_world.pl`

A couple of notes

* Strings and numbers
* Strings must be quoted, you can use special characters such as "\n"
* The **print** statement (Output) - gets comma delimitered list of things
* ; after every statement
