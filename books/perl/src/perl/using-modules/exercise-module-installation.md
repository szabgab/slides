# Exercise: Module installation


```
Install the Acme::EyeDrops module from CPAN and write a script
to draw a camel. As you are not root, you might need to install it in
a local subdirectory.

Create a simple script that does some simple computation.
Create a script using Acme::EyeDrops that will use the above simple script as
source.
Save your camel in a file.
Run the file containing the camel using Perl.
