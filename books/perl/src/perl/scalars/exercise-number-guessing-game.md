# Exercise: Number Guessing game

Using the rand() function the computer "thinks" about a whole number between 1 and 200.

The user has to guess the number. After the user types in
his guess the computer tells if this was bigger or smaller than
the number it generated.


At this point there is no need to allow the user to guess several times.
