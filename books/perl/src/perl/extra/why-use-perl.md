# Why use Perl ?

* Easy  - for daily use
* Nearly unlimited - for high-level programming (no real time, no kernel, no device drivers please)
* Mostly fast - fast enough for the tasks you would do with Perl
* Can solve problems - the symbol of Perl is the camel, ugly but can handle difficult environment
