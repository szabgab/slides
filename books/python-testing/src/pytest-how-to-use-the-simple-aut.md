# How to use the module?

Before we try to test this function let's see how could we use it?

There is nothing special here, I just wanted to show it, because the testing is basically the same.

{% embed include file="src/examples/pytest/math/use_mymath.py" %}
{% embed include file="src/examples/pytest/math/use_again_mymath.py" %}
