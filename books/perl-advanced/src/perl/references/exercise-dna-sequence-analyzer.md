# Exercise: DNA Sequence Analyzer

Create a function for researching DNA sequences. Below, you can see the "source" file.
There is all kind of extra information, that is currently not interesting to us.
Implement the read_file function that goes over the given file extracting and returning the list
of all the DNA sequences. The user of your function can now, create a foreach-loop going over
the list of DNA sequences and call her own function that will analyze the sequence
and print the results. See the input file, the skeleton of the solution in which I already
added the analyze function the end user is going to write. The expected output can be also found.
(Of course this read_file should work regardless of what the analyze function does.)
