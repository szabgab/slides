# Python Flask intro

* Flask
* Jinja
* Werkzeug

Flask is a light-weight web micro-framework in Python. By default it uses a templating system called Jinja and a WSGI web application library called Werkzeug.

In Flask you map URL paths to functions so when someone reaches the endpoint defined by the path the specific function is executed.
The function is expected to return the HTML to be displayed.

It is very easy to get started with Flask both if you'd like to build a web-site with HTML pages or if you are interested in providing an API that returns JSON.
