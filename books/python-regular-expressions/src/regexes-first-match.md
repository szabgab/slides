# Regexes first match

{% embed include file="src/examples/regex/search.py" %}


The search method returns an object or **None**, if it could not find any match.
If there is a match you can call the **group()** method. Passing 0 to it will
return the actual substring that was matched.

* r
* re
* search|re
* group|re
