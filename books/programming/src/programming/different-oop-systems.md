# Different OOP systems


* Java - Hello World needs a class, but numbers and strings by themselves are not objects.
* Python - Even strings and numbers are objects, but you can just write a single line to print.

{% embed include file="src/examples/hello_world.py" %}
{% embed include file="src/examples/HelloWorld.java" %}


```
"abc".upper()
```
