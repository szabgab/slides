# Top down approach

* Pick the value stream to be the first to convert:
* Start with the team that has the most open attitude to the new way of work.
* Educate people. Both about the ideas and about the techniques.
* Find the first bottleneck that is in your power to change.
* Reinforce learning culture.
* Instead of adding more people to the team, improve the way the team works.
