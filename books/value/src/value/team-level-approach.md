# Team level approach

* Start writing tests.
* For every new feature, for every bug.
* Include time for refactoring.
* Set up Continuous Integration
* Work on standardized environment (Requirements, VMs, Containers)

At first this will take you extra time. Later you will see the value. Put it in the estimates. They are part of your job.

* Allocate at least 20% of your time to this.
