# What is in there for me, the developer?

Most engineers I know want to enjoy work and be proud of their accomplishments.

* Safer work place - no fear of change, no fear of release.
* Better working environment.
* Much less bugs and rework of the same code.
* Allow you to do other work when this is done

* Learn new things.
* Learn better development practices that will be relevant in your next job as well.
