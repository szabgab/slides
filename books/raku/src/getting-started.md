# Getting started

* Rakudo
* MoarVM
* JVM
* Niecza
* CLR
* Pugs


* Raku is a specification and a set of tests.
* Any compiler that passes all the tests is considered to be a valid Raku compiler.
* There are several compilers for Raku.
* As of today, they are all partial and implement only a subset of the language.

* [Rakudo](http://rakudo.org/) can run on any one of the following back-ends: [MoarVM](http://moarvm.com/), the [JVM](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_virtual_machine).
* [Niecza](http://github.com/sorear/niecza) is a compiler targetting the Common Language Runtime (.NET and Mono).
* Pugs written in Haskell was the first usable implementation, but it is currently only minimally maintained.

We are going to use Rakudo with MoarVM.
