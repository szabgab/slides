There are lots of string functions in PHP. Here are a few examples:



* strcmp - compare two string returns, -1, 0 +1 based on order according to ASCII table
* strcasecmp
* explode - split string to elements and return an array
* implode - join array to make a string
* nl2br - new line to html-break
* file_get_contents - read in a whole file without explicitely opening (slurp)
* str_replace - replace characters in a string
* iconv - convert between character encodings: iconv('ISO-8859-8', 'UTF-8', $str)
* urlencode - when we are generating URLs some characters (e.g. space) need to be encoded
