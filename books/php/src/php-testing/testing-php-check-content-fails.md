# Check web page content a failure

It's really nice to see everything working but there will be
times when you encounter a problem. For example that certain text
is missing from the web page:


{% embed include file="src/examples/php/simpletest/web04.php" %}


Will fail with the following output


{% embed include file="src/examples/php/simpletest/web04.txt" %}
