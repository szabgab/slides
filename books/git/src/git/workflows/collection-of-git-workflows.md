# A collection of workflows and issues


* Individual developer, local changes only

Change, commit, push  - not very exciting.

* Individual developer, local changes only, using stash for small interruptions

This time the `git stash pop` might need to handle merge conflicts.

* Individual developer, both local and remote changes (e.g. a pull-request was accepted using the web site of GitHub)

Need to pull before push. One might need to merge or rebase and one might need to handle conflicts.

* Individual developer, working in branches

* A single main developer + multiple helpers

The latter forking the repository and sending pull-requests

* Multiple developers on the same repo - single main branch

* Multiple developers on the same repo - development branches and Pull-requests
