# Github fork

Forking on Github will create another copy of the public repository, but in your own user-space.
You then clone from that place. Make changes locally, commit them and push them to your own public repository.

Integration: You can send a `pull request` to the author via the Github web site.
He can then either merge your changes on the Github site or can do it on his local machine.
