# Exercise: compare files

Compare two files line-by-line, and create a 3rd file listing the lines that are different.

{% embed include file="src/examples/iterators/first.txt" %}
{% embed include file="src/examples/iterators/second.txt" %}

Expected output:

{% embed include file="src/examples/iterators/diff.txt" %}
