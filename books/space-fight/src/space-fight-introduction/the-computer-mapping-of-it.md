# The computer mapping of it


* The computer "thinks" about a random whole number we call "hidden" number. (This is the distance of the enemy space-ship from us.)
* We guess a whole number.
* The computer tells us if our number is the same as the hidden number or if it is less than or greater than that number.

* In the advanced level the "hidden number" can change a little bit.
