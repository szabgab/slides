* [slider-py](https://github.com/szabgab/slider-py) is the code that generates the slides.
* [code-maven.com](https://github.com/szabgab/code-maven.com) is the repository of all the content.
* [Code-Maven workshops](https://workshops.code-maven.com/) and on [GitHub](https://github.com/szabgab/workshops/)
