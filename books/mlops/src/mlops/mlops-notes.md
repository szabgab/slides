# MLOps notes

* logging
* metrics
* data-pipelines


* Data is changing (new type of data, the same data but a newser dataset)
* Model

* Monitor the quality of the model over time
* The standard tools measuring precision and recall in classification, accuracy, F-measure (F1)

* data quality
* model decay (due to changes in the data that are not used to re-train the model)
* locality (using the same model on a different set of data, eg. a different cluster of customers)

* Distributed learning
