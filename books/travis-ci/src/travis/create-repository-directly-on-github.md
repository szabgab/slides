# Create repository directly on GitHub


In either case first on GitHub create a project called travis-demo and make sure you check the box next to "Initialize this repository with a README" and then clone the repos.


* If you'd like to use your editor and git client then clone the project:

```
git clone git@github.com:szabgab/travis-demo.git
```

* I assume you know how to edit files, commit and push them out.
