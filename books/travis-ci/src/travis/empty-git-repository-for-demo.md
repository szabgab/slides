# Empty Git repository for demo

To get started we are going to use a Git repository that is almost empty. It only has a README file in.
We need to visit GitHub with our browse to create the repository at first and then we can decide if we'd like to
contnue use the GitHub UI or if primarily we'd like to use our editor and git client on our computer.


* Use the [GitHub UI](https://github.com/)
* Use a Git client on your computer
