# Add

What is the result of this code in Perl / Python / JavaScript / Rust?

{% embed include file="src/examples/python-types-at-pyweb-2025-05/add.rs" %}

{% embed include file="src/examples/python-types-at-pyweb-2025-05/add.py" %}

{% embed include file="src/examples/python-types-at-pyweb-2025-05/add.js)

{% embed include file="src/examples/python-types-at-pyweb-2025-05/add.pl" %}

```
rustc add.rs
```


* The Rust code will have a compilation error.

* The Python code will have a runtime exception.

* The Perl code will print the correct answer: 42.


However, in these example the problem is in-front of us. We can easily see it.
