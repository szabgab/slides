# Create multiline file in GitHub Action



In this workflow example you can see several ways to creta a file from a GitHub Action workflow.

I am not sure if doing so is a good practice or not, I'd probbaly have a file someone in the repository and
a script that will copy it, if necessary. Then I'd call that script in my YAML file.


{% embed include file="src/examples/workflows/create_file.yml" %}
