# Switch (case) in JavaScript

* switch
* case
* default
* break

* You'd better call "break" at the end of each "case" statement or this will fall through and will execute all the lower cases without checking their condition.
* Switch uses === for comparision.
* We can put variables instead of the fixed values in the 'case' statements.
* If the same value appears in more than one 'case', only the first one will match.
