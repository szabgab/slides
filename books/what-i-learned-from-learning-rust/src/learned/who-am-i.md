# Who am I


* I am self-employed and a large chunck of my work is teaching people how to improve their programming life. This included teaching them how to use git and how to use it properly. How to write automated tests, how to setup a CI system. It includs also teaching programming langiages. Perl when that was the popular language. Then I Python, and now it might be Rust. Is it?
