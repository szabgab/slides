# Jenkins: Testing Python


* Setup testing a simple project in Python
* Replace the "Execute Shell" by ./run_jenkins




  Don't forget to add   #!/bin/bash  at the begining
  Virtualenv (clean it every time we use it)
  Before running the tests make sure the environment is clean
    git status is clean **git status** "nothing to commit, working tree clean"
    **git clean -xfd** there are no untracked files, not even ones that are ignored. - remove all untracked file
