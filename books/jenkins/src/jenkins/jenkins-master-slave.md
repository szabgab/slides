# Jenkins master/slave


* In Jenkins, as in many other software project the terminology master/slave was in use.
* The word **master** is still in use describing the central Jenkins server.
* Instead of the word **slave** these days the Jenkins project mostly uses **worker** or **agent**.
* You'll still encounter the word "slave" in many places hence I leave this explanation here.
