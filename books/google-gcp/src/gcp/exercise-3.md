# Exercise 3


* Make sure you have a server running!.
* If you don't have it yet, create an ssh key on your local computer.

* Add the public key to the project-wise Meta-Data
* Try to ssh to the remote servers public IP using the command-line ssh client.
* Add a label to the instance.
* Record the current public IP address.
* Shut down the instance.
* Start it again, observe the change in public IP address.
* Create a fixed IP address.
