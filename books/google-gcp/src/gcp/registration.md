# Registration

* [Google Cloud](https://cloud.google.com/)
* Credit Card
* Some free usage

I strongly recommend you use your own private Google account for this and you create your own Google Cloud account
and you don't use your employers account. If for no other reason, then because in that corporate account you might
have certain limitations that will make it impossible to do some of the exercises.

Google provides you with some credit to experiment with their services without actually paying money, but they still
require a valid credit card to create the account. If you don't want to provide that then I am afraid you won't
be able to try this.
