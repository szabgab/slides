# OpenCV blur image

* blur

* Average the intensity of all the pixels in the kernel (window)
* Median - helps reduce the nois in the image
* [Gaussian blur](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaussian_blur) - less blurring than the average blurring, but more natural

* Increasing the ksize (kernel size) and the image will be more blurred.
