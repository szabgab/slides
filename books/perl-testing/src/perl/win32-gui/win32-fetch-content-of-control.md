# Fetch content of a control

* WMGetText

{% embed include file="src/examples/Win32GUI/calc05.pl" %}


Catch the content of the first child.
At this point we can only hope that this is the child that holds the result
as it does not have a title, maybe it has a type that we can check ?
Or maybe it is time to ask the engineers to give a title to this control ?
