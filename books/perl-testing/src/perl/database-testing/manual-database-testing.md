# Database testing

This can be considered as part of any application as there is some kind of a database
used by every application. In the simple case the 'database' might be a flat file but
it can also be some csv file or xml file or an RDBMS that you can access using SQL.
In this case you would like to test what are the consequences on the database
of certain operations of the application ?



* Prepare a database
* Execute some code
* Check if the database was updated correctly
