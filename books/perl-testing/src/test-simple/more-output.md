# More test cases, more output


Still, if the output is more complex than a single, short number,
or if there are many results, it will be difficult
to the person comparing to notice the differences.

What if we have 100s of test cases?


{% embed include file="src/examples/test-simple/tests/t04.pl" %}

Output:

{% embed include file="src/examples/test-simple/tests/t04.pl.out" %}
