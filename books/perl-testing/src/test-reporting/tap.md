# TAP - Test Anything Protocol


* TAP
* IETF

```
1..3
ok 1
ok 2
not ok 3
```



All printing of "ok" and "not ok" are part of TAP - Test Anything Protocol.




Work is under way to turn it into an IETF standard.

We run our test scripts either using plain perl, or via prove or make test.
They all generated textual output. Some very verbose, others a more concise
aggregate report of the results. None of them is really pleasing to the eye.
