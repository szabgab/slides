# When is mocking useful?


* TDD - Test Driven Development

* Write application agains API that is not ready yet or not controlled by you.

* Replace a complex object with a simpler one.

* Isolate parts of the system to test them on their own.

* Speed up tests (e.g. eliminate remote calls, eliminate database calls).

* Simulate cases that are hard to replicate. (What if the other system fails?)

* Unit tests.
