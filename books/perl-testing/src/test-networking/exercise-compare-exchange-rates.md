# Exercise: Compare exchange rates

Go to various sites, check the AAA/BBB exchange rate on each one of them.
Print out the current exchange rate and also send an e-mail to yourself 
with the information.
Also put a ARBITRAGE warning if there is a difference between the rates.

AAA and BBB can be any two currencies you are interested in.
