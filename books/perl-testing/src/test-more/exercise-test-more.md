# Exercises


* Take a local copy of the Math::RPN module located in (examples/Math-RPN) and add 30 test cases. See what is [Reverse Polish Notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_Polish_notation).
* You can also look for a module on [CPAN](https://metacpan.org/) - maybe one that you are using a lot.  Maybe one that you found a problem with.
* Download the tar.gz file from CPAN unzip it (don't install the module) and write at least 20 tests.
