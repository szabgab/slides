# bc - An arbitrary precision calculator language


It is much more than a calculator, it is a language.
Luckily we don't need to learn the whole language in order to
to do simple calculations.
Normally you execute 'bc' from the command line and then you type in
your calculations. Pressing ENTER will do the calculation.
