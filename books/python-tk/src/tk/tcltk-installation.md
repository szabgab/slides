# Installation

Tk in Python is actually a wrapper arount the implementation in Tcl.

Tcl/Tk usually comes installed with Python. All we need is basically the Tkinter Python module.
In some Python installations (e.g. Anaconda), Tkinter is already installed. In other cases you might
need to install it yourself. For examples on Ubuntu you can use `apt` to install it.


```
sudo apt-get install python3-tk

pip install tk
```
