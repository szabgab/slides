# Python Tk Documentation

The documentation of Tk in Python does not cover all the aspects of Tk. If you are creating a complex GUI
application you might need to dig in the documentation written for Tcl/Tk.


* [Tk](https://docs.python.org/library/tk.html)
* The [Tk Command](https://www.tcl.tk/man/tcl8.6/TkCmd/contents.htm) of [Tcl 8.6](https://www.tcl.tk/man/tcl8.6/)
* [Python GUI Geeks for Geeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/python-gui-tkinter/)



In the Unix world where Tk came from the various parts of a GUI application are called widgets. In the MS Windows world
they are usually called controls. There are several commonly used Widgets. For example, Label, Button, Entry, Radiobutton, Checkbox.
First we are going to see small examples with each one of these Widgets. Then we'll see how to combine them.
