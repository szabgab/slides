# Exercise: Tk - a GUI for a grep-like application

The GUI should accept:

* A filename, a wilde-card expression, maybe a dirctory name (and then a flag to recurse or not).
* A regular expression.
* Various flags for regex.

* Then it should display the lines that match the expression in the selected files.
