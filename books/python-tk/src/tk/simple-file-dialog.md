# Simple file dialog

* filedialog
* askopenfilename


This is another way of using the Tk widgets. Here we have a plain command-line script, but instead of using the
standard `input()` function of Python to ask for a filename it launches a Tk File-dialog widget to allow the user to browse
and select a file.
