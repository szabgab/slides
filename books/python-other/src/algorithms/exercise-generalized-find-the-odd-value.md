# Exercise: Generalized find the odd value

* Given a list of values, we know that every value comes in groups of N except one group that has less than N element. Given the list and the number N find where it starts:

* f(["a", "a", "a", "b", "b", "b", "x", "d", "d", "d"], 3)  would return 6
* f(["a", "a", "a", "b", "b", "b", "x", "y", "d", "d", "d"], 3)  would return 6
