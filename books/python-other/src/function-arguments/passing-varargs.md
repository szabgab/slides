# Passing arguments as they were received (but incorrectly)

What if we need to pass the list of individual arguments (or pairs) to another function?

{% embed include file="src/examples/function-arguments/passing_varargs.py" %}
{% embed include file="src/examples/function-arguments/passing_varargs.out" %}

g() received 2 individual parameters, the first was a tuple, the second a dictionary
