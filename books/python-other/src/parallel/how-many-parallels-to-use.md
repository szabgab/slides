# How many parallels to use?

* First of all, I call them "parallels" as this applies to forks, threads, spawns, and even to async code.

* Overhead of creating new parallel.
* Overhead of communication (sending job input to parallel, receiving results).
* Total number of items to process.
* Time it takes to process an item.
* Distribution of processing times. (e.g. one long and many short jobs.)
* Number of cores (CPUs).
