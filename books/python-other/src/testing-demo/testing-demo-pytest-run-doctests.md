# Testing demo: pytest run doctests

The nice thing about `pytest` that it can also run all the doctests in your module.
So you can start your testing journey with doctest and later switch to pytest.

You can easily test your examples in your documentation.


```
$ pytest --doctest-modules mymath.py
```
