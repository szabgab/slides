# from `__future__`

```
from __future__ import print_function
from __future__ import division
```

or


```
from __future__ import print_function, division
```

See also [__future__](http://docs.python.org/library/__future__.html)




We cannot import everything that is in __future__, because we don't know what will be in __future__ in the future....
and we don't want to blindly change the behaviour of Python.
