# Variable scope

* scope

* There are two scopes: outside of all functions and inside of a function.
* The first assignment to a variable defines it.
* Variables that were declared outside all functions can be seen inside, but cannot be changed.
* One can connect the outside name to an inside name using the 'global' keyword.
* if and for blocks don't provide scoping.
