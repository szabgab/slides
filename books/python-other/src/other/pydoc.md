# pydoc

If you really want it, you can also read some of the documentation on the command line, but unless you are locked up some place without Internet connection,
I don't recommend this.

Type `pydoc`. On Windows, you might need to create the following file and put it in a directory in your PATH. (see `echo %PATH%`)


{% embed include file="src/examples/other/pydoc.bat" %}
