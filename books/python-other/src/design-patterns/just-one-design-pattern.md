# Creation DPs "Just One"

we want just one instance to exist


* Singleton - subclassing can never be really smooth
* Use a module instead of a class (no inheritance, no special methods)
* make just one instance (self discipline, no enforcement), need to decide to "when" (in which part if the code) to make it
* monostate (borg)
