# What are Design Patterns?

Not all the Design Patterns discussed for Java or C++ are interesting, relevant or even needed in Python.
Design Patterns are formal descriptions of how people do things, and not how you should do things.
The formal description makes it easy to talk about them.

Some of the DPs exists to overcome problems in that specific language.
Oher DPs are more general, solving classes of problem that are generic.
