* Common decorators are [@classmethod](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#classmethod) and  [@staticmethod](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#staticmethod).
* [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/) uses them to mark and configure the routes.
* [Pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/) uses them to add marks to the tests.

* [functools](https://docs.python.org/library/functools.html)

* [dataclasses](https://docs.python.org/library/dataclasses.html)
* Logging calls with parameters.
* Logging elapsed time of calls.
