# Linear regression

Housing prices (size in feet => price in USD)


* m - number of examples in the dataset
* X's - input variables, features
* y's - output variables, target variables
* (X, y) - single training example
* (Xi, yi) - i-th training example

* Training set => Learning Algorithm => h (hypothesis)
* is function that converts X to estimated y.  `y = h(X)` as it is a linear function we can also write h(x) = ax^2 + b  (a, b could be theta 0 and 1)

* Linear regression with one variable (aka.) Univariate Linear regression.
