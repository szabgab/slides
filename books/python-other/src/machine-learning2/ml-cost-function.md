# Cost function

* Squared error function: `J(a, b) = (sum of (h(xi) - yi)^2)/2m`  where `h(x) = ax^2 + b`
* It is probably the most common used for linear regression problems because it seems to work the best in most cases.
* We would like to find `a` and `b` so `J(a, b)` is minimal.

* If we assume b=0 then we are looking at `min(J(a, 0))` which is a 2D function
* In the general case though `min(J(a, b))` is a 3D function for which we need to find the minimum


* Contour plots (contour figures)
