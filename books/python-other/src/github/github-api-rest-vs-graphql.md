# GitHub API: REST vs GraphQL

* **REST API**
* Get data in the structure as the API provider though you'll need it.
* Usually all the data from one table in the database.

* **GraphQL API**
* Have a mapping (edges) between pieces of data that are connected

* Getting the data you need, nothing more
* Nested fields
* Strong typing of the data
* Rare limits
