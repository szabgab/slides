# ML - Supervised Learning

* We have a dataset that has the "right answer".
* It has one or more "features" (or independent variables, or just variables) (X) and one or more results (y).
* We would like to create a function that given a new set of values for X will predict the value(s) of y.


* Regression
* Classification
