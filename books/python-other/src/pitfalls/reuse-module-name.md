# Reuse of existing module name

{% embed include file="src/examples/pitfalls/random.py" %}

```
$ python examples/pitfalls/random.py
```
{% embed include file="src/examples/pitfalls/random.out" %}

* Write an example to use random number and call your example **number.py**
* Same with any other module name.
* Lack of multi-level namespaces
* Solution: user longer names. Maybe with project specific names.
