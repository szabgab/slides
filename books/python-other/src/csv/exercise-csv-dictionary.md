# Exercise: CSV as dictionary of dictionaries

Create a script called **monty_python_dictionary_of_dictionaries.py** that given a file like the CSV file of Monty Python troupe (examples/csv/monty_python.csv" %},
will create a dictionary where we can look up information about them based on the first name. For example:

{% embed include file="src/examples/csv/read_mp_dictionary_skeleton.py" %}
