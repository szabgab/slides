# Exercise: SNMP numbers


* SNMP numbers are strings consisting a series of integers separated by dots: 1.5.2,  3.7.11.2
* Create a class that can hold such an snmp number. Make sure we can compare them with less-than (the comparision is pair-wise for each number until we find two numbers that are different. If one SNMP number is the prefix is the other then the shorter is "smaller").
* Add a class-method, that can tell us how many SNMP numbers have been created.
* Write a separate file to add unit-tests
