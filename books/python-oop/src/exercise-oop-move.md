# Exercise: Add move_rad to based on radians

* From the **Python: Methods** take the examples/oop/methods/shapes.py and add a method called **move_rad(dist, angle)** that accpets a distance and an angle and moved the point accordingly.


```
delta_x = dist * cos(angle)
delta_y = dist * sin(angle)
```
