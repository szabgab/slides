# Exercise: Number


Turn the Number guessing game into a class. Replace every print statement with a call to an output method.
Do the same with the way you get the input.
Then create a subclass where you override these methods.
You will be able to launch the game with a hidden value you decide upon.
The input will feed a pre-defined list of values as guesses to the game
and the output methods will collect the values that the game prints in a list.
