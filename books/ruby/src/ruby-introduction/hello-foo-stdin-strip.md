# Hello Foo STDIN and strip


* STDIN
* gets
* strip


The solution is to remove the newline from the end of the string. We can do this using the `strip` method:


{% embed include file="src/examples/intro/hello_foo_stdin_strip.rb" %}

Now if we run the program and identify as `Bar`, the output will look the way we wanted:


```
Hello Bar, how are you?
```
