# Docker Registry

A Docker registry is a place where we can store reusable Docker images. There are several public or semi-publick Docker Registries and you can also
run your own private registry in your organization. The most well known registry is maintained by Docker itself.
The major cloud providers run their own registries tightly integrated with their other cloud services.
