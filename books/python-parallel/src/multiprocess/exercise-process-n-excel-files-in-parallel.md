# Exercise: Process N Excel files in parallel

* Create N Excel files with 10 random numbers in the first row of each file. This should be **create_random_excel.py**.
* Write a process that reads the N Excel files and sums up the numbers in each one of them and then sums up the numbers of all the files. This should be **add_excel.py** that gets the list of Excel files on the command line.
