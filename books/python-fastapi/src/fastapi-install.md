# Install FastAPI

* [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/) to build web application back-ends that serve JSON or other data formats.

* Python 3.8 or newer is needed

* In order to get started one needs to install FastAPI manually, or, as we can see on the next page add it as part of the `requirements.txt` file.

```
pip install "fastapi[all]"
```
