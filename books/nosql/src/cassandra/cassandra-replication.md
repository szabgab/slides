# Cassandra: Replication


* RF = Replication Factor (how many times each piece of data is replicated)
* CL = Consistency Level (ONE, QUORUM, ALL) (How many reads or writes need to happen before we consider the read or write "done")
* ONE= 1 machine
* QUORUM = majority of the RF machines
* ALL = all of the RF machines
