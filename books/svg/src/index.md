# SVG


On a computer, every image is made out of pixels in various colors. The color of each pixel can bre representad by 3 basic color factors: Red, Green, and Blue.

If on the screen there are a lot of small pixel (if the screen has a good resolution) then the image is very smooth. People won't notice that the image is made of pixels. Still they are just pixels.

If we would like to change the size of the image we have to figure how to handle the pixels.

There are various formats to store such images that you are familiar with: PNG, JPG etc.

Together all these are called **raster images**.


There is an alternative that can be good for some images. We can store instructions on how to draw various shapes. When the computer needs to display such an image it follows the instructions and draws the shapes.

These images are called **vector images**.

There are several such system. We are going to discuss SVG - the Scalable Vector Graphics.
