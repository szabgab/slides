# Install Dancer2


* cpanm
* Dancer2

* Install [cpanm](https://metacpan.org/pod/App::cpanminus) if you don't have it yet:

```
curl -L https://cpanmin.us | perl - App::cpanminus
```

* Install Dancer2:

```
cpanm Dancer2
```


Note, during the following pages I am going to use the word Dancer, however the name of the package we are using is Dancer2
and there is also a package called Dancer which was the first incarnation of this framework.
