# Exercise: color selector


* Create a file similar to the colors.txt file and use it as the list of colors in the earlier example where we prompted for a color.
* Call the new script **color_selector_file.py**

{% embed include file="src/examples/files/colors.txt" %}

Extend the previous example by letting the user provide the name of the file on the command line:
`python color.py examples/files/color.txt`
