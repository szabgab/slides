# Direct access of a line in a file



{% embed include file="src/examples/files/access_list_element.py" %}

**Output:**

{% embed include file="src/examples/files/access_list_element.out" %}

{% embed include file="src/examples/files/fh_access.py" %}
{% embed include file="src/examples/files/fh_access.err" %}


This does NOT work because files can only be accessed sequentially.


{% embed include file="src/examples/files/read_all_lines.py" %}

{% embed include file="src/examples/files/count_lines.py" %}
