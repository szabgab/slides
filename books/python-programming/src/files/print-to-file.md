# Print to file

* open
* print


We can also use the `print` function to print (or write) to a file. In this case the same rules apply as printing to
standard output (automatically adding a trailing newline, inserting a space between parameters). We do this
by passing the file-handle as the value of the `file` parameter of `print`.
