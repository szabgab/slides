# Exercise: count digits

Create a script called **count_digits_in_lists.py** that given a list of numbers count how many times each digit appears? The output will look like this:


```
0  1
1  3
2  3
3  2
4  1
5  2
6  2
7  0
8  1
9  1
```

* Use this skeleton

{% embed include file="src/examples/lists/count_digits_skeleton.py" %}
