# Duplicate input call

* Ask the user what is their ID number.
* Check if it is a valid ID number. (To make our code more simple we only check the length of the string.)
* Ask again if it was not a valid number.

{% embed include file="src/examples/loops/duplicate_input_call_with_if.py" %}

* Realize, that if the user types in an incorrect string for the 2nd time, our code does not check it.
