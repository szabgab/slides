# Exercise: Age limit with dictionaries


* Create a file called **age_limit_with_dictionary.py**
* Ask the user what is their age and in which country are they located.
* Tell them if they can legally drink alcohol.
* See the [Legal drinking age](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legal_drinking_age) list.

* Given a file like the following create a new file with a third column in which you write "yes", or "no" depending if the person can legally drink alcohol in that country.
