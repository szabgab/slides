# Exercise: Merge files with timestamps


* Write a script called **merge_files_with_timestamps.py**
* Given a few CSV files in which the first column is a timestamp, write a script that can merge the files so the merged result also has timestamps in increasing order.
* First try to solve it for 2 files.
* Then solve it for any N files.
