# Exercise: Count words


* Create a script called **count_words_in_lists.py** that given a list of words (for now embedded in the program itself) will count how many times each word appears.

{% embed include file="src/examples/lists/count_words_skeleton.py" %}

Expected output:

```
Moon        2
Gas         1
Asteroid    3
Dwarf       1
```
