# Exercise: Age limit

* Create a script called **basic2_age_limit_input.py**

* Ask the user what is their age.
* If it is above 18, tell them they can legally drink alcohol.
* If is is above 21, tell them they can also legally drink in the USA.

* Extra:
* Create a separate file **basic2_age_limit_all_input.py**
* Ask the user for an age and a country name tell them if they can legally drink alcohol.
* See the [Legal drinking age](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legal_drinking_age) list.
* Don't worry if this seems to be too difficult now to solve it in a nice way.
