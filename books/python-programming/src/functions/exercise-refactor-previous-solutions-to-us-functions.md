# Exercise: Refactor previous solutions to use functions


* Go over all of the previous exercises and their solutions (e.g. the games)
* Take one (or more if you like this exercise) and change them to use functions.
* If possible make sure you don't have any variable definitions outside of the functions and that each function has a single job to do.
* For each case use the same filename just add at the end: **with_functions.py**
