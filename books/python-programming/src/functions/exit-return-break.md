# Exit vs return vs break and continue

* exit
* return
* break
* continue

* **exit** will stop your program no matter where you call it.
* **return** will return from a function (it will stop the specific function only)
* **break** will stop the current "while" or "for" loop
* **continue** will stop the current iteration of the current "while" or "for" loop
