# Exercise: Module my_sum


* Create a file called `my_simple_math.py` with two functions: `div(a, b)`, `add(a, b)`, that will divide and add the two numbers respectively.
* Add another two functions called `test_div` and `test_add` that will test the above two functions using assert.
* Add code that will run the tests if someone execute `python my_simple_math.py` running the file as if it was a script.
* Create another file called `use_my_simple_math.py` that will use the functions from `my_math` module to calculate  2 + 5 * 7
* Make sure when you run `python use_my_simple_math.py` the tests won't run.
* Add documentation to the "add" and "div" functions to examples that can be used with doctest.

* Can you run the tests when the file is loaded as a module?
