# Scope of import

{% embed include file="src/examples/modules/mydiv.py" %}
{% embed include file="src/examples/modules/division.py" %}


The importing of functions, and the changes in the behavior of the compiler are file specific.
In this case the change in the behavior of division is only visible in the division.py script, but not in the mydiv.py module.
