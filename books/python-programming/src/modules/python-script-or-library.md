# Script or library

* __main__
* __name__


We can have a file with all the functions implemented and then launch the run() function only if the file was executed as a stand-alone script.


{% embed include file="src/examples/modules/mymodule.py" %}

```
$ python mymodule.py
Name space in mymodule.py  __main__
run in  __main__
```
