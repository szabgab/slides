# Exercies: Raise My Exception


This is very similar to the exercise the first chapter about exceptions, but
in this case you need to create your own hierarchy of exception classes.

* Write a function that expects a positive integer as its single parameter.
* Raise exception if the parameter is not a number.
* Raise a different exception if the parameter is not positive.
* Raise a different exception if the parameter is not whole number.
* In each case make sure both the text and the type of the exceptions are different.
* Include the actual value received as an attribute in the exception object.
