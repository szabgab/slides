# Home made exception



You can create your own exception classes that will allow the user to know what kind of an exception was caught or to capture only the exceptions of that type.


{% embed include file="src/examples/exceptions/home_made_exception.py" %}

**Output:**

{% embed include file="src/examples/exceptions/home_made_exception.out" %}
