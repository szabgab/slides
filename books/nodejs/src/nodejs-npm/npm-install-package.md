# npm install PACKAGE


```
npm install module
npm uninstall module
```

* This will install in the `node_modules` folder in the directory where the package.json can be found
* And it will add the name of the package to packege.json as well declaring it as a dependency
* It will also create a file called `package-lock.json`.
* Both json files should be added to git and the node_modules/ directory should be added to gitignore
