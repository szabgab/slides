# npm init


* Create a directory for the project (eg. mynode) and cd into the directory

```
npm init
```

This will aske a few questions and create the package.json file.

The questions, and the default answers, you can just accept the defaults.

```
package name: mynode
version: 1.0.0
description:
entry point: index.js
test command:
git repository:
keywords:
author:
license (ISC):
```

```
npm init --yes
```

* Would populate the file with the defaults without asking emberassing questions.
