Change CSS based on

* min-height
* max-height
* min-device-height
* max-device-height
* device-aspect-ratio
* orientation (portrait or landscape)

You can use `and`, and the comma `,` to indicate `or` and even the word `not` to have the full
power of boolean expressions.

You can use **@media queries** inside a single style-sheet, or you can load different style-sheets base on the @media query.

Probably the most common thing to use @media queries for is to change the site depending on the width of the browser
using the min-width and max-width fields, but you can also use the others listed above.


Of course you can also use it to check the media type: screen, print, etc.
