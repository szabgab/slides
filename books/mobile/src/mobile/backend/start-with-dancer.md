# Start with Dancer


* dancer

* **dancer -a App::Name**
* cd App-Name
* perl bin/app.pl
* browse to http://localhost:3000
* edit views\index.tt
* edit App-Name/lib/App/Name.pm




The dancer -a command will create the App-Name subdirectory with several files.
Most importantly for us, the App-Name/lib/App/Name.pm
