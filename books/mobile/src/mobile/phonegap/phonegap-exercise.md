# Exercise: PhoneGap Build



Follow the "Process" in the earlier slide: creat a simple web application, eg. an input box, and a button,
and when the button is clicked, show the content of the input box elsewhere on the page. Then push it out to github.




Sign up to PhoneGap and set this project as an open source project and build it.




Try to install it on your mobile device.



Then update your application and install it again.
