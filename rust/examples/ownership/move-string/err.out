error[E0382]: borrow of moved value: `name`
 --> examples/ownership/move_string.rs:8:15
  |
2 |     let name = String::from("Foo");
  |         ---- move occurs because `name` has type `String`, which does not implement the `Copy` trait
...
5 |     let other = name;
  |                 ---- value moved here
...
8 |     println!("{name}"); // value borrowed here after move
  |               ^^^^^^ value borrowed here after move
  |
  = note: this error originates in the macro `$crate::format_args_nl` which comes from the expansion of the macro `println` (in Nightly builds, run with -Z macro-backtrace for more info)
help: consider cloning the value if the performance cost is acceptable

5 |     let other = name.clone();
