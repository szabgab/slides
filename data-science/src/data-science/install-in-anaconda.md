# Install Python modules on Windows (Anaconda)


* Open the "Anaconda Prompt"
* Type in `conda list seaborn` to see if seaborn is already installed
* (it will show something like this, if it is installed):

```
# packages in environment at C:\ProgramData\Anaconda3:
#
# Name                    Version                   Build  Channel
seaborn                   0.9.0                    py37_0
```

* Install `seaborn` by typing `conda install seaborn`

* If all else fails you can also try `pip install seaborn`
