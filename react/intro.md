* Check if we have node

```
$ node -v
v14.18.3
```

* TODO: install node, npx


Create project dir

```
$ mkdir react-demo
$ cd react-demo
```

Create react application

```
$ npx create-react-app .
```

* I guess we could just write `npx create-react-app react-demo` from the outside

* Once it is done it prints out a bunch of commands to use:

```
  npm start
    Starts the development server.

  npm run build
    Bundles the app into static files for production.

  npm test
    Starts the test runner.

  npm run eject
    Removes this tool and copies build dependencies, configuration files
    and scripts into the app directory. If you do this, you can’t go back!

We suggest that you begin by typing:

  cd /home/gabor/work/react-demo
  npm start
```

* It even created a git repository here and committed everything we need to commit
