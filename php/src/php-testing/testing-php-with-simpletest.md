# Introduction to the PHP SimpleTest framework

* simpletest


That's all very nice but someone has already implemented this with a lot
of other nice features. We are going to look at the SimpleTest framework
of PHP.

[Simpletest](http://www.simpletest.org/)

I am looking at the currently latest 1.0.1 version that already includes autorun.php.

Ubuntu packages the PHP Simpletest package but
`sudo aptitude install php-simpletest`
only gets you version 1.0 which is relatively old.

So the best course of action is to download the simpletest_1.0.1.tar.gz
file from the Simpletest web site and unzip it in a place where your
web server can reach it.
