# Hello world

* echo
* &lt;?php
* .php



Embedded in an html file, code between &lt;?php and ?&gt; tags is executed as PHP code. The result printed by that code is embedded in the HTML page.
While the mapping of URLs to files is configurable in the web server, PHP files usually end with the **php** extension.

{% embed include file="src/examples/intro/hello_world.php" %}
