* Browser -> HTTP Request -> Web Server (Apache, IIS, Nginx)
* Web Server -> HTTP Response -> Browser
* Simple response: Content of file as is (HTML, image, etc.)
* CGI Response: Execute the file and return its output
* PHP: Pass the file to the PHP Engine that runs within Apache
* Others: JSP, ASP, mod_perl
