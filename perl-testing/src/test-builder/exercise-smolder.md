# Exercise: Smolder


Check if Smolder is already installed and start it.
Add one or more users to it and at least one project and create some associations.
Then run the prove command with the archiving option on the examples/tap files and upload
the resulting file manually using your browser.


Change the test scripts a bit adding more tests. Change tests from success to failure and
from failure to success. After every change run the tests again generating the archive file
and upload it to Smolder. The first few results you should upload manually but later switch
to the use of Smolder smoke signaler.
