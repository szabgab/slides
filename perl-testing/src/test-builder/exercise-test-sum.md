# Exercise: test sum



Write a test for the sum() function without parameter.
Normally it should return 0 and should not give any warnings.
So try to write a test that check there is no warning in this call
but mark it as TODO as it is currently failing but we have decided to
postpone it fix after we finish more urgent tasks.
