Reset web site to the point we need to start testing.




We can install the Selenium IDE in Firefox, record a session
interacting with a web site and then we can replay it with Firefox.

We start the recording by click on Tools/Selenium IDE.
A new window will show, that is the Selenium IDE. We'll
be able to stop the recording by pressing the red button.
Then we can export the recorded script in several languages.
