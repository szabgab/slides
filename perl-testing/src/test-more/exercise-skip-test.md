# Exercise: skip test


* Write a test that will be skipped if is run as root. (Administrator on Windows?)
* And another test that will executed only when not run as root.
* Write a test script called long.t that takes a long time to run. Execute it only if the RUN_LONG environment variable is true.
* Other ideas: Skip tests that need database access and/or tests that need network access.
