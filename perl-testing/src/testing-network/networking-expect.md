# Expect.pm

* expect


As we saw earlier Expect.pm with some low level networking protocol can be used to
access any device that can be connected via some cable.

Or without a cable.

But you might not want to implement the whole protocol, or you might not
have a command line tool that can access the device remotely.
Or you don't want to use it as you'd like to test that separately.


You can use the built-in telnet/ssh/ftp/tftp clinets in your Unix/Linux machine.
