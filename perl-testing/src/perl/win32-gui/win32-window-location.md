# Window location

* GetWindowRect

{% embed include file="src/examples/Win32GUI/calc11.pl" %}



As we would like to start to use the mouse now, first we should find out where are,
we and where is the window?




Check the location of the windows.
Run this script several times and see the data.
As we can see all 4 values change so while the first two are x and y coordinates of
the top left corner the other two values are not width and height. Looking at the data
more closely we can see that the two other values are the coordinates of the bottom right
corner.
