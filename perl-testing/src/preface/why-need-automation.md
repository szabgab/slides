# Why Automate?

1. Why do we need automated tests when we can test manually?
1. Isn't that just waste of time/money?
1. We could add more features instead.




Mostly for the regression but in some cases it is very hard or
impossible to test manually.

Writing tests can be a huge expense.
Running tests the 2nd time is where you start to see the benefit.
After 10 or 100 times you'll really see the profit.
