# Test page with JavaScript

* WWW::Mechanize::Firefox

* No single JavaScript engine, certainly there won't be those used in versions of IE
* There are several Open Source implementations
* Test only the data as it was sent
* Use a real browser (e.g. driven by [WWW::Mechanize::Firefox](https://metacpan.org/pod/WWW::Mechanize::Firefox) that needs [MozRepl](http://wiki.github.com/bard/mozrepl/) )
* Use Selenium
