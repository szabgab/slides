# Print only ok/not ok


Good so we are going to implement that now. For every test unit we
create an if statement that will print either "ok" or "not ok"
depending on the result.


{% embed include file="src/examples/test-simple/tests/t05.pl" %}


Output:


{% embed include file="src/examples/test-simple/tests/t05.pl.out" %}


The output is as we expected. I mean we already know there is a bug somewhere.
We are supposed to report it to the developers, but right now we are focusing on improving our
test suite and its reporting capabilities.
