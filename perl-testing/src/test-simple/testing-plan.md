# Things we are going to test


* Test a module
* Test complex Perl applications
* Test any application


As an introduction to testing with Perl, first we are going to write
unit tests for a simple Perl module.

From there, we'll be able to move on to test more complex applications
written in Perl. Then to test any application no matter in what
language it is written in.
