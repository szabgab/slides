# Test::Simple when everything is ok





For the following example we've replaced the failing test with one that is successful.
This way you can see how does it look like when everything is ok.


{% embed include file="src/examples/test-simple/tests/t11.pl" %}

Output:

{% embed include file="src/examples/test-simple/tests/t11.pl.out" %}

```
$ echo $?
0
```

```
> echo %ERRORLEVEL%
0
```
