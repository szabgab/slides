# Test with expected results


We should write the expected value next to the actual result:

In order to make it obvious what are the expected values first we have to compute
them ourself - or bring in the expert, or the client who knows what she expects
from the application to display - and make sure the expected values are always written
next to the actual results.

That way it will be obvious to any tester what values need to be compared.

{% embed include file="src/examples/test-simple/tests/t03.pl" %}


Output:

{% embed include file="src/examples/test-simple/tests/t03.pl.out" %}

Now it is better.
