# Hello World in Java

* System.out.println
* System
* println


Printing Hello World on the screen is a bit more complex in Java than in many of the so-called scripting languages, but still it
is probably the most simple thing you can do in the language. So let's see it.

Create a file with a name like HelloWorld.java . The extension .java is important , so is the name.
In the file we create a class with the same name as the name of the file.


{% embed include file="src/examples/java/HelloWorld.java" %}

```
$ javac HelloWorld.java       # Compiles the file and creates HelloWorld.class
$ java HelloWorld
Hello World
```
