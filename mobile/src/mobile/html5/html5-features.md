# HTML5 Features


HTML5 is not one big set of feature, but instead it is a set of individual feature. Each
browser supporting a subset of it. Which just makes it more difficult to build using it...

HTML5 adds new tags *and* corresponding API in the DOM (Document Object Model).


* Canvas - to draw using JavaScript.
* Video - to play video without extra plugins.
* Local Storage - to hold a lot of data on the client.
* Web Workers - threadding for your JavaScript in the browser.
* Offline web application - to download web elements and store locally.
* Geolocation - to know where the client is.
* Input types
* Placeholder text in input fields
