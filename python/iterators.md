## Advantages of iterators and generators
{id: advantages-of-iterators-and-generators}

* Lazy evaluation
* Save processing (or at least delay the use)
* Save memory
* Handle an infinite series of information
* Turn complex operations into a simple matter of `for` loop.

## The Fibonacci research institute
{id: the-fibonacci-research-institute}

* We have a bunch of mathematicians who research the Fibonacci series.

* We have a bunch of people who research a series of DNA sequences.

## Fibonacci plain

## Iterators Glossary
{id: iterators-glossary}

* [iterable](https://docs.python.org/glossary.html#term-iterable) (Can be iterated over using a `for` loop.)
* [iterator](https://docs.python.org/glossary.html#term-iterator)
* Every iterator is also iterable
* Iterators (and iterables) are not necessarily addressable like lists with the `thing[index]` construct.

## What are iterators and iterables?
{id: what-are-iterators-and-iterables}

* All of them are iterables
* A filehandle and the map object are also iterators. (Side note: You should always `open` files using the `with` statement and not like this.)
* `iter()` would return the iterator from an iterable. We don't need this.

## A file-handle is an iterator
{id: file-handle-as-iterator}
{i: collections}
{i: Iterator}
{i: Iterable}
{i: io}
{i: TextIOWrapper}
{i: issubclass}

{aside}
This slightly a repetition of the previous statement, that filehandles are iterators.

## range is iterable but it is not an iterator
{id: range-is-an-iterator}

{aside}
Just as a string or a list, the `range` function in Python is also an "iterable" but it is not an "iterator".
In many aspects it behaves as an iterator. Specifically it allows us to iterate over numbers.

## Iterator: a counter
{id: iterator-counter}
{i: StopIteration }
{i: next}
{i: __iter__}
{i: __next__}

{aside}
We can create a iterator using a class. We are required to implement the `__iter__` method that returns the iterator object
and the `__next__` method that returns the next element in our iteration. We can indicated that the iteration was exhaused
by raising a `StopIteration` exception.

The instance-object that is created from this class-object is the iterator, not the class-object itself!
{/aside}


* `__iter__`
* `__next__` (in Python 2 this used to called `next`)
* `raise StopIteration`

## Using iterator
{id: using-iterator}

{aside}
The class returned an iterator, we could use a `for` loop to iterate over the element.
We tried to run through the iterator again, but it did not print anything. It was exhausted.

## The type of the iterator
{id: type-of-iterator}

{aside}
How can we know it is an iterator? We check it.

## Using iterator with next
{id: using-iterator-with-next}
{i: next}

{aside}
A feature of any iterator is that we could iterate over it using the `next` call.

![](examples/iterators/simple_iterator_next.out)

## Mixing for and next
{id: mixing-for-and-next}

{aside}
You can even use `next` inside a `for` loop, but then you will have to handle the `StopIteration` exception
that migh happen during your call of `next`.

I am not really sure when would we want to use this.

## Unbound or infinite iterator
{id: unbound-iterator}

{aside}
So far each iterator had a beginning and an end. However we can also create infinte or unbounded iterators.
The nice thing about them is that we can pass them around as we do with any other object and we can execute
operations on them without burning our CPU.

Of course the user will have to be carefull not to try to flatten the iterator, not to try to get all the values
from it, as that will only create an infinite loop or a never ending operation.

In this very simple example we count from 0 and we never stop.

When we use the `Counter` in the `for` loop we need to include a stop-condition, otherwise our loop will never end.

## Unbound iterator Fibonacci
{id: unbound-iterator-fibonacci}

{aside}
Now we can get back to our original problem, the slightly more complex Fibonacci series. In this example we created
an unbounded iterator that on every iteration will return the next element of the Fibonacci series.

* [itertools](http://docs.python.org/library/itertools.html)

{aside}
itertools is a standard Python library that provides a number of interesting iterators.
We are going to see a few examples here:
{/aside}

## itertools - count
{id: itertools-count}
{i: count}

* Unbound counter: Count from N to infinity.

## itertools - cycle
{id: itertools-cycle}
{i: cycle}

## Exercise: iterators - reimplement the range function
{id: exercise-reimplement-the-range-function}

In one of the first slides of this chapter we saw a partial implementation of the `range` function.
Change that code to have a full implementation, that can accept 1, 2, or 3 parameters.


## Exercise: iterators - cycle
{id: exercise-reimplement-cycle}

* Reimplement the cycle functions of itertools using iterator class.

## Exercise: iterators - alter
{id: exercise-iterators-alter}

* Implement the alter functions as an iterator that will return

```
1
-2
3
-4
5
-6
...
```

* Optionally provide a start and end parameters
* start defaults to 1
* end defaults to unlimited

## Exercise: iterators - limit Fibonacci
{id: exercise-iterators-limit}

Change the Iterator version of the Fibonacci series so optionally you will be able to provide
a parameter called "limit" to the constructor. If the limit is provided, the iterator should stop
when the value passes the limit.


## Exercise: iterators - Fibonacci less memory
{id: exercise-iterators-only}

Change the Iterator version of the Fibonacci series so it will NOT hold the previous values in memory.


## Exercise: read char
{id: exercise-iterators-read-char}


Create an iterator that given a filename will return an object that on every iteration will
return a single character. As an option let the user skip newlines, or maybe any pre-defined character.

## Exercise: read section
{id: exercise-read-section}

* Create an iterator that given the name of a file like the following, will return once section at a time.
* It will return a list one each iteration and each element of the list will be a line from the current section.
* Other ideas what should be returned on each iteration?

![](examples/iterators/sections/planets.txt)


## Exercise: collect packets
{id: exercise-collect-packets}

* You get a series of packets (e.g. lines in a file)
* In each line you have several fields: id, seqid, maxseq, content
* id is a unique identifier of a series of packets (lines)
* seqid is the seuence id of a packet in a series. (an integer)
* maxseq is the length of the sequence.
* content is the actual content.

In each iteration return a message that is built up from all the packages in the given sequence.
