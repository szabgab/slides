## Do NOT Compare different types!

![](examples/boolean/compare.py)

In `Python 2` please be careful and only compare the same types.
Otherwise the result will look strange.


```
Yes
No
Yes
No
```

In `Python 3`, comparing different types raises exception:

## Boolean values: True and False
{id: boolean-values}
{i: True}
{i: False}

{aside}
In this chapter we are going to talk about boolean values and operations on boolean values.

Unlike in some other languages Python actually has 2 special symbols to represent True and False.

(In those languages 0 usually represents False and 1 represents True.)
{/aside}

* True
* False

## Comparison returns True or False

## Assign comparisons to variables
{id: assign-comparisons-to-variables}

* True and False are real boolean values.

{i: False}
{i: True}

## Flag
{id: flag}

![](examples/boolean/flag.py)

## Use flag to skip first few lines
{id: use-flag-to-skip-first-few-lines}

We have a series of rows that we might read from a file and would like to process the sections of rows that start with a well-defined row. Unfortunately the file does not always start with a row that matches the definition. In some cases there are a few lines at the beginning of the file that we need to throw away before we can start our processing.

In this exacmple we use series of numbers to represent the rows of that file and the "well defined condtion to start the series is a number being "big".

We can use a variable as a "flag" to indicate if we are still before the first good section or if the sections already started.

## Does this value count as True or False?
{id: any-boolean-value}

![](examples/boolean/boolean.py)


## True and False values in Python
{id: false-values}
{i: None}

* None
* 0
* "" (empty string)
* False
* []
* {}
* ()

Everything else is true.

![](examples/boolean/boolean_values.py)

`None` is like undef or Null or Nill in other languages.



## Incorrect use of conditions
{id: incorrect-use-of-conditions}

{aside}
In your normal speech you could probably say something like "If status_code is 401 or 302, do something.".
Meaning status_cone can be either 401 or 302.

If you tried to translate this into code directly you would write something like this:
{/aside}

```
if status_code == 401 or 302:
    pass
```

{aside}
However, this is incorrect. This condition will always be true  as this is actually same as if you wrote: 
`if (status_code == 401) or (302)` so it will compare status_code to 401, and it will separately check if
302 is True, but any number different from 0 is considered to be True so the above expression will always be True.
{/aside}

What you probably meant is this:

```
if status_code == 401 or status_code == 302:
    pass
```

Alternative way:

{aside}
An alternative way to achieve the same results would be though probably at this point we have not learned the "in"
operator, nor lists (comma separated values in square brackets):
{/aside}

```
if status_code in [401, 302]:
    pass
```

## Exercise: compare numbers
{id: exercise-compare-numbers}

* Create a file called **bool_compare_numbers.py**
* Ask the user to enter two numbers and tell us which one is bigger.

## Exercise: compare strings
{id: exercise-compare-strings}

* Create a file called **bool_compare_strings.py**
* You can use the `len()` function to get the length of the string.
* Ask the user to enter two strings
* Then ask the user to select if she wants to compare them based on Unicode or based on their length
* Then tell us which one is bigger.

```
Input a string: (user types string and ENTER)
Input another string: (user types string and ENTER)
How to compare:
1) Unicode
2) Length
(user types 1 or 2 and ENTER)
```
