# .git/info/exclude


You can have a file called `.git/info/exclude` with similar format to the `.gitignore` file where you would list
the files that should be ignored only on your computer. I don't think it is a good practice to use this.

* Others might have the same files that need to be excluded.
* You might move to a different computer and need to set that up manually.
