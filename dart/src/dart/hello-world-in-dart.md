**dart hello_world.dart**




Every Dart script must have a **main** subroutine that returns **void**,
but we actually don't need to explicitly mention **void**.

Statements end with semi-colon: ;

**print** needs parentheses (as most functions do) and automatically appends a newline at the end of the output.
