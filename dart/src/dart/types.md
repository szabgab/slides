* Integers are arbitrary precision (but not in JS)
* Doubles are 64 bit
* Strings are UTF16
* Bools are true or false



Variables are either const, final, or ?? (normal?)
Both const and final can be assigned only at the time of declaration, but
final can be assigned during run-time while const can only get values that are either fixed
or can be in-lined. Such as 1+2.
