# Linux Users

If we had a full linux system we would have users, and home directories for the users.
We would use the system as one of these users and use either `su` to switch to the root user
or better yet `sudo` to run one-off commands as the `root` user.


* users (root and other users)
* /home directory
* su
* sudo

```
ls /root
ls /home/
```
