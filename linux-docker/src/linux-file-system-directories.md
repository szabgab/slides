# Linux File system - directories



On Linux (actually in the shell we user) there are many commands to deal with the filesystem.
Some of them are listed here.


```
ls
ls -l
ll

alias

pwd

cd home
cd ..
cd root

mkdir docs
mkdir docs/text
mkdir documents
mkdir xyz

rmdir xyz

cd TAB

```

* `ls` list the content of a folder.
* `alias` create aliases for commands so we won't have to type them.
* `pwd` print (current) working directory.
* `cd` change directory
* `mkdir` make directory
* `rmdir` remove directory
* Use TAB completition where possible!
