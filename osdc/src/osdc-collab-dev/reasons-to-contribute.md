# Reasons to contribute

* Why do people contribute to open source pojects?
* What is the motivation of people to contribute to open source projects?


* That is the job.
* Want to fix a bug / add a feature to something that the person uses.

* Hope for better employment opportunities.
* Project that used by the company has a bug, needs a feature, needs documentation, tests.
* You want to learn something new. Doing it is the best way to learn it.
* For fun.


On one end there are people who work at some company that happens to develop an open source product or an open source library (e.g. a driver to their own propriatery database).
In this case the people working on open source do so because that's what they were told to do. They get paid for their work. In many cases these project have two version control systems and two bug-tracking systems.
One internal to the company where they might discuss requests from clients and their own priorities. Then there is the public VCS with its public issue-tracker.

You use an open source product, e.g. Firefox, VLC, Wordress, or Moodle. There is a bug that annoys you or a feature you really want to have. On one hand the promise of Open Source is that you can make those changes
both technically as you have access to the source code and legally as you have the proper licenses. On the other hand these are large and very complex applications and are probably written in a programming language
that you are not familiar with.


## Do you need to be a programmer to contribute to open source projects?

A common misconception is that only programmers can contribute to open source project. Being a programmer of course make it possible for you to make changes to the source code of the application,
but there are tons of other things that need to be done in a project. Especially if it a large, end-user facing project such as Firefox, VLC, Moodle, or mdbook.

QA - Quality Assurance. There is always a need to help checking the quality of these open source projects.

Someone needs to act as the product manager trying to understand what the users would like to have and if that's something the product should actually do.

Someone needs to provide customer support.

Someone needs to write documentation.

Maybe there is a need for creating "marketing material". That could be a nice web site for the project, a logo, nice images etc.

There is also a need to help  with fundraising. Many open source projects and many open source developers could do a lot more if they got some payment for their time.
