# Reasons to contribute

* Why do people contribute to open source projects?
* What is the motivation of people to contribute to open source projects?


* That is the job.
* Want to fix a bug / add a feature to something that the person uses.

* Hope for better employment opportunities.
* Project that used by the company has a bug, needs a feature, needs documentation, tests.
* You want to learn something new. Doing it is the best way to learn it.
* For fun.


On one end there are people who work at some company that happens to develop an open source product or an open source library (e.g. a driver to their own proprietary database).
In this case the people working on open source do so because that's what they were told to do. They get paid for their work. In many cases these project have two version control systems and two bug-tracking systems.
One internal to the company where they might discuss requests from clients and their own priorities. Then there is the public VCS with its public issue-tracker.

You use an open source product, e.g. Firefox, [VLC](https://www.videolan.org/), [WordPress](https://wordpress.org/), or [Moodle](https://moodle.org/). There is a bug that annoys you or a feature you really want to have. On one hand the promise of Open Source is that you can make those changes
both technically as you have access to the source code and legally as you have the proper licenses. On the other hand these are large and very complex applications and are probably written in a programming language
that you are not familiar with.


## Do you need to be a programmer to contribute to open source projects?

A common misconception is that only programmers can contribute to open source project. Being a programmer of course make it possible for you to make changes to the source code of the application,
but there are tons of other things that need to be done in a project. Especially if it a large, end-user facing project such as [Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/), [VLC](https://www.videolan.org/), [Moodle](https://moodle.org/), or [mdbook](https://rust-lang.github.io/mdBook/).

QA - Quality Assurance. There is always a need to help checking the quality of these open source projects.

Someone needs to act as the product manager trying to understand what the users would like to have and if that's something the product should actually do.

Someone needs to provide customer support.

Someone needs to write documentation.

Maybe there is a need for creating "marketing material". That could be a nice web site for the project, a logo, nice images etc.

There is also a need to help  with fundraising. Many open source projects and many open source developers could do a lot more if they got some payment for their time.



## Scratch your own itch

Historically the most common reason to contribute to Open Source was "scratching your own itch". That is a person used a piece of open source software that had an annoying bug or
the person wanted to have a feature that did not exist. With proprietary software one cannot not do anything. Even reporting the bug or submitting the feature request is almost
impossible in most of the cases. Getting the company that developed the software to acknowledge and fix the problem hardly ever happens.

With open source it is usually very easy to report the problem and if the person has the technical knowledge then, at least in theory the bug can be fixed or the feature can be added.

In reality it can be a lot more complex than "just fix it" depending on the complexity of the project and the culture around it, but regarding the primary motivation, this is probably
the strongest. So if you would like to contribute to an open source project, one of the best direction might be to find a project you use that has some issues and fix that.

I am going to go over a number of projects to see how easy or difficult it might be to contribute to that project.


## Customer support - help - documentation

Developers might think that customer support is not a fancy thing, but it turns out providing help to the users is sorely missing in most open source projects.
Both in large projects such as [Moodle](https://moodle.org/) or [VLC](https://www.videolan.org/) and in smaller ones like [mdbook](https://rust-lang.github.io/mdBook/).

There are always people who don't know how to do thing with the software or who encounter things that don't work as they expected. Each Open Source project has some forum
where people can ask questions or report problems. Figuring out what is the solution and verifying if reported problem is indeed a problem with the product takes a lot
of time. Taking that off the hands of the core developers will help them a lot, and it is also an excellent way to make yourself familiar with the application and the code base.

In many cases the reported issue comes in because the user did not find the documentation describing how that part works. If there is no such documentation, then this is an opportunity
to add it. If there is such documentation then maybe the wording has to be adjusted. There are many cases where user are not familiar with the jargon used in the project or are
for some other reason they are using words different from what you have in the documentation.

For example recently I was trying to figure out [as a reader how to get notification when new version is published](https://help.leanpub.com/en/?q=as+a+reader+how+to+get+notification+when+new+version+is+published)
but I could not find the answer. I sent an email to their support. Within a few hours I got be a link to explanation and a note, that they have updated the response with the keywords I used.

We are all different, we use different words, most of us are not native English speakers, and even the English speakers use different words or different spellings for the same thing depending on their country.

So by improving the documentation you can reduce the frustration of the users. You can reduce the time wasted on support. You can do it pro-actively writing documentation or you can do that in response to
question by users.
