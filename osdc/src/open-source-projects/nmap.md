# How to contribute to nmap?


As described on its web site [nmap](https://nmap.org/) is a **Network exploration tool and security / port scanner**.

It is a command line tool that also has an official GUI called [Zenmap](https://nmap.org/zenmap/)

As a Cyber Security expert you are probably already familiar with it or if not yet then this is a good opportunity to learn how to use it.



In any case the first step to contribute to a project is to learn how to use it. Try to accomplish various tasks.
This will bring up questions. Try to find answers to those question. If you cannot find a good answer in the official documentation,
that can be the first thing to contribute. Once you learn the correct answer.

Visiting the project web site I noticed that it is basically maintained by a single person as shown on the [about/contact page](https://insecure.org/fyodor/)

Under [docs](https://nmap.org/docs.html) I see it has its documentation translated to 15 languages. Is yours among them? Does that translation need help. (They almost always do.)
If your language is not there, maybe consider doing the translation.

Visiting the GitHub repository of nmap, I saw there are several languages used in the repository: C, Lua, C++, Shell, Python. This both provides opportunity to more people to contribute, but might also make it a lot more difficult to contribute code as you might need to be familiar with more than one language.

It also seems that the project actually uses Subversion as its main repository and the GitHub is only a mirror. However there are some 276 Open and 617 Closed Pull-requests on
the GitHub repository so apparently you don't need to deal with Subversion in order to contribute.

There are also 591 Open issues that need attention.

Running **zenmap** on the command line revealed that it is written in Python. It seems to be in the same repository as zenmap itself.

Apparently nmap was featured in some really [high-profile movies](https://nmap.org/movies/), such as the Matrix and Ocean's 8.
