# Your own project


Pro: You can decide on everything:

* programming language
* technology stack
* architecture
* code layout
* testing

Contra: You have to do everything yourself.

* programming
* documentation
* examples
* design
* logo
* web site for the project

* No users.
* No cooperation from others (at least at the beginning).
* No community.

Advice:

* Something like that probably already exists. Maybe better finding it and contributing to that project.
* Take an existing proprietary product and implement an open source alternative
