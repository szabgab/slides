# Planned Assignments


* Will be in some public GitHub or GitLab repositories
* At the end of each assignment you'll write a report - a blog post / journal entry.
* You will add it to your personal JSON file and send a Pull-Request with the change. (We'll learn these soon)

* In order to create a substantial contribution to an established project you would probably have to spend 10s of hours learning about the project.
* Contributing to small, relatively new projects needs less time as there are a lot more "easy" things to do.
* Contributiong "meta" data, instructions on how to setup development environment needs almost no internal knowledge of the project.
* Setting up CI needs knowledge about the programming language and the tooling of that language, but not the specific project.
* Writing test requires you to know how to USE the project, but not necessarily the internals.

* We start with a few projects developed by the lecturer - that way you can get fast feedback.
* Then we'll have a few relatively simple changes to a number of open source projects.
* Then we'll have a few slightly more difficult contributions.
