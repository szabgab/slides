# Create variable and print content using puts

* =


The next step after greeting the world is greeting the programmer.
However, before we get there we would like to create a variable.
We created a variable called `person` and put the name of the programmer in it.
We also say we assigned a value to a variable.
For whatever reason most of the programmer are called `Foo` so we'll go with that name here too.

We then use `puts` to print out the content of the variable.

This will print `Foo` to the screen.
