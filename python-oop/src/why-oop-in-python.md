# Why Object Oriented Programming?


* Better encapsulation of intent.
* Integration between data and functionality (attributes and methods)
* Better modelling for some part of the world.
* Another level of code-reuse.
* Clearer separation between "usage" and "implementation". (Private data in some cases)
* Clearer connection between "classes" of things.
* In reality: avoid using "global".
