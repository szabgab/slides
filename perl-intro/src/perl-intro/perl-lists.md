# Lists


A list is a series of scalar values separated by comma and enclosed in parentheses.
The scalar values themselves can be references to other data structures.
(An array, explained later is a variable holding the content of a list.)

```
('string', 42, 2.3, undef, ['one', 'two'], { 'name' => 'Foo Bar' })
```
