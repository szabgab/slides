### Feature branching

For many years the central problem of version control systems was that they did not provide good branching tools. Actually branching wasn't the real problem, merging was. However without good merging, branching was really a pain.
With the popularity of git marging and thus branching got a lot easier which lead to the made feature branching a lot more popular than before.
However, feature branching also has drawback. In particular it has a huge tension with the idea of Continuous Integration and thus with Continuous Delivery.

### Fast feedback loop



### How to know your software works correctly?

We write software because we would like to make sure it does something useful without errors. The big question is of course how do we know our software works.
Ultimately the question boils down to whether the user (customer, client, whatever word you use there) is satisfied.  BDD Acceptance testing
