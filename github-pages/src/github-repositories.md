## Repositories

* On GitHub you can store as many `git` repositories as you like. They can be either private or public.
* The names of the repositories are arbitrary.
* https://github.com/USERNAME/REPO-NAME
* https://github.com/ORGANISATION/REPO-NAME

* Some repository names have special meanings.
* USERNAME
* USERNAME.github.io

For me they are
* [https://github.com/szabgab/szabgab](https://github.com/szabgab/szabgab)
* [https://github.com/szabgab/szabgab.github.io](https://github.com/szabgab/szabgab.github.io)
