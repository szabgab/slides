# Multitasking Exercise


Exercise: Write down 3 sets of values while measuring the time to get the following results:

```
0  1   2  3  4   5    6     7   8  9
a  b   c  d  e   f    g     h   i  j
I II III IV  V  VI  VII  VIII  IX  X
```

First time write these horizontally:

* First write down the Arabic numbers.
* Then the Latin letters
* Then the Roman numbers.

In the next round write the same ones down, but this time start by writing down the first value of each, then the second value of each. (So you'd first write down 0, a, I, then 1, b, II etc.)

Observe how much longer the second method takes.
