# Resilience testing

* Intentionally cause problems during the work day and see how the tools and the team react.
* Randomly kill processes and compute servers in production to see how the monitoring system and the whole team reacts
* Do this often during work hours and reduce the risk of such thing happening during the nights.
* Fix any issues. Learn.
