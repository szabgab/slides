  JOB_NAME:
    # ...
    steps:
    - name: SOME NAME
      if: ${{ false }}
```

## Create multiline file in GitHub Action
{id: create-multiline-file-in-github-actions}

{aside}
In this workflow example you can see several ways to creta a file from a GitHub Action workflow.

I am not sure if doing so is a good practice or not, I'd probbaly have a file someone in the repository and
a script that will copy it, if necessary. Then I'd call that script in my YAML file.

## Workflow Dispatch (manually and via REST call)
{id: workflow-dispatch}

![](examples/workflows/workflow_dispatch.yml)

## Run in case of failure
{id: run-in-case-of-failure}

![](examples/workflows/in-case-of-failure.yml)

You can create a step that will run only if any of the previous steps failed.
In this example if you enable the "ls" statement in "Step one" it will fail
that will make Step two execute, but Step three won't because there was a failure.

On the other hand if Step One passes then Step Two won't run.
Step three will then run.

A failure in step three (e.g. by enabling the ls statement) will not make step Two run.


## Setup Droplet for demo
{id: setup-droplet-for-demo}

```
apt-get update
apt-get install -y python3-pip python3-virtualenv
pip3 install flask
```

copy the webhook file

```
FLASK_APP=webhook flask run --host 0.0.0.0 --port 80
```

* [GitHub Repository used for demo](https://github.com/szabgab/github-actions-demo-20201224/)

## Integrated feature branches
{id: integrate-feature-branches}

* Commit back (See Generate GitHub Pages)

* Don't allow direct commit to "prod"
* Every push to a branch called /release/something  will check if merging to "prod" would be a fast forward, runs all the tests, merges to "prod" starts deployment.

## Deploy using Git commit webhooks
{id: deploy-using-git-commit-webhook}

* Go to GitHub repository
* Settings
* Webhooks

```
Payload URL: https://deploy.hostlocal.com/
Content tpe: application/json
Secret: Your secret
```

* Go to GitHub repository
* Settings
* Environments
* New Environment
* Name: DEPLOYMENT
* Add Secret:
*  Name: DEPLOY_SECRET
*  Value: HushHush

* curl from GitHub action
* we need to send a secret, a repo name, and a sha

## Deploy using ssh
{id: deploy-using-ssh}

```
ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "user@host" -q -N "" -f ./do
ssh-copy-id -i do.pub user@host
```

* Add Secret:
*   Name: PRIVATE_KEY
*   Value: ... the content of the 'do' file ...

```
ssh-keyscan host
```

* Add Secret:
*   Name: KNOWN_HOSTS
*   Value: ... the output of the keyscan command ...

## Artifact
{id: artifact}

* In the first job we create a file called date.txt and save it as an artifact.
* Then we run 3 parallel jobs on 3 operating systems where we dowload the artifact and show its content.

![](examples/workflows/artifact.yml)


## Lock Threads
{id: lock-threads}

* Automatically lock closed Github Issues and Pull-Requests after a period of inactivity.
