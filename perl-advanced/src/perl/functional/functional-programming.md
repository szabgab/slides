# Functional programming

* Immutability (variables don't change)
* Separation of data and functions.
* Pure functions (no side-effects)
* First-class functions (you can assign function to another name and you can pass function to other functions and return them as well. We can also manipulate functions)
* Higher order functions: a functions that either takes a function as a parameter or returns a function as a parameter.
