# Exercises: Multiply numbers

* Write a script with a function to multiply numbers **sub multiply**.
* Once it is ready move the multiply subroutine to the library.pl file that already has the **add** subroutine and write a script that can use it.
* Create a package called Exercise::Calc that will export the multiply function.  Write a script that will use this module and the given functions.
* Write a few test cases for both the add and multiply functions. Including test cases where you try to add 3 or more numbers. As the tests are failing, mark them as TODO.
* Fix the add() function so it passes its new tests with 3 or more parameters.
* Add short user documentation that can be read by perldoc.
* Create the files necessary for distributions and make sure you can generate the tar.gz file.
