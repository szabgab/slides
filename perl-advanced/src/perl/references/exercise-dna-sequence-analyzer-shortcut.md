# Exercise: DNA Sequence Analyzer with shortcut

What if you would like to provide the user the ability to stop
the processing any time she wants even if the file has not finished yet?
For example when she found the first match. This can be controlled
by the return value of the analyze function. If it is true, stop processing.
See the skeleton and the expected output: 


{% embed include file="src/examples/references/dna3_skeleton.pl" %}
{% embed include file="src/examples/references/dna3.out" %}
