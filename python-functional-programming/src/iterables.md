# Iterators (Iterables)

You already know that there are all kinds of objects in Python that you can iterate over using the **for in** construct.
For example you can iterate over the characters of a string, or the elements of a list, or whatever **range()** returns.
You can also iterate over the lines of a file
and you have probably seen the **for in** construct in other cases as well. The objects that can be iterated over are collectively called
[iterables](https://docs.python.org/glossary.html#term-iterable).
You can do all kind of interesting things on such **iterables**. We'll see a few now.

* A few data type we can iterate over using the **for ... in ...** construct. (strings, files, tuples, lists, list comprehension)
