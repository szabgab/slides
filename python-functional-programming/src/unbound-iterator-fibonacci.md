# Unbound iterator Fibonacci

Now we can get back to our original problem, the slightly more complex Fibonacci series. In this example we created
an unbounded iterator that on every iteration will return the next element of the Fibonacci series.

{% embed include file="src/examples/iterators/unbound/fibonacci.py" %}
{% embed include file="src/examples/iterators/unbound/fib.py" %}

**Output:**

{% embed include file="src/examples/iterators/unbound/fib.out" %}
