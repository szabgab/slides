# Exercise: min, max, factorial

* Implement an expression to calculate "min", and another expression to calculate "max" of lists.
* Implement an expression that will calculate factorial. f(n) should return the value of n! (n! = n * (n-1) * (n-2) * ... * 1)
* Implement an expression that given 2 lists will return a new list in which each element is the max() for each pair from the input lists. E.g. given [1, 3, 6] and [2, 4, 5]  the result is [2, 4, 6]
* Use reduce, map, lambda
