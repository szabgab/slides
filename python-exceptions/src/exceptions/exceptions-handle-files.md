# Handle files - exception


* FileNotFoundError


We can add multiple "except" statement at the end of the "try" block and handle several exceptions. Each one in a different way.


{% embed include file="src/examples/exceptions/handle_both_exceptions.py" %}

```
python handle_both_exceptions.py one.txt zero.txt two.txt three.txt
```
