# Catch all the exceptions and show their type


* Exception


We can also use the "except Exception" to catch all exceptions. In this case we might want to also print out the text and the type of the exception by ourselves.


{% embed include file="src/examples/exceptions/show_exception_type.py" %}

```
python show_exception_type.py one.txt zero.txt two.txt three.txt
```
